    documentation:
      'Specific contexts, like Staff and Voice, are made from simple building blocks. It is possible to create new types of contexts with different combinations of engraver plug-ins.\n\nThe next example shows how to build a different type of Voice context from scratch. It will be similar to Voice, but only prints centered slash note heads. It can be used to indicate improvisation in jazz pieces,\n\nThese settings are defined within a \\context block inside a \\layout block,\n\n    \\layout {\n      \\context {\n        …\n      }\n    }\n\nIn the following discussion, the example input shown should go in place of the … in the previous fragment.\n\nFirst it is necessary to define a name for the new context:\n\n    \\name ImproVoice\n\nSince it is similar to the Voice context, we want commands that work in (existing) Voice contexts to continue working. This is achieved by giving the new context an alias of Voice,\n\n    \\alias Voice\n\nThe context will print notes and instructive texts, so we need to add the engravers which provide this functionality, plus the engraver which groups notes, stems and rests which occur at the same musical moment into columns,\n\n    \\consists "Note_heads_engraver"\n    \\consists "Text_engraver"\n    \\consists "Rhythmic_column_engraver"\n\nThe note heads should all be placed on the center line,\n\n    \\consists "Pitch_squash_engraver"\n    squashedPosition = #0\n\nThe Pitch_squash_engraver modifies note heads (created by the Note_heads_engraver) and sets their vertical position to the value of squashedPosition, in this case 0, the center line.\n\nThe notes look like a slash, and have no stem,\n\n    \\override NoteHead.style = #\'slash\n    \\hide Stem\n\nAll these plug-ins have to communicate under the control of the context. The mechanisms with which contexts communicate are established by declaring the context \\type. Within a \\layout block, most contexts will be of type Engraver_group. Some special contexts and contexts in \\midi blocks use other context types. Copying and modifying an existing context definition will also fill in the type. Since this example creates a definition from scratch, it needs to be specified explicitly.\n\n    \\type "Engraver_group"\n\nPut together, we get\n\n    \\context {\n      \\name ImproVoice\n      \\type "Engraver_group"\n      \\consists "Note_heads_engraver"\n      \\consists "Text_engraver"\n      \\consists "Rhythmic_column_engraver"\n      \\consists "Pitch_squash_engraver"\n      squashedPosition = #0\n      \\override NoteHead.style = #\'slash\n      \\hide Stem\n      \\alias Voice\n    }',

Nested contexts which are not included in the outer context’s “accepts” list will be repositioned below the outer context rather than nested within it.\n\nThe “accepts” list of a context can be changed with the \\accepts or \\denies commands. \\accepts adds a context to the “accepts” list and \\denies removes a context from the list.\n\nFor example, a square-braced staff group is not usually found within a curved-braced staff with connecting staff bars, and a GrandStaff does not accept a StaffGroup inside it by default.\n\n    \\score {\n      \\new GrandStaff <<\n        \\new StaffGroup <<\n          \\new Staff { c'1 }\n          \\new Staff { d'1 }\n        >>\n        \\new Staff { \\set Staff.instrumentName = bottom f'1 }\n      >>\n    }\n\nHowever, by using the \\accepts command, StaffGroup can be added to the GrandStaff context:\n\n    \\score {\n      \\new GrandStaff <<\n        \\new StaffGroup <<\n          \\new Staff { c'1 }\n          \\new Staff { d'1 }\n        >>\n        \\new Staff { \\set Staff.instrumentName = bottom f'1 }\n      >>\n      \\layout {\n        \\context {\n          \\GrandStaff\n          \\accepts \"StaffGroup\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n\\denies is mainly used when a new context is being based on another, but the required nesting differs.

To demonstrate each style, we use the following example:\n\n    musicA = {\n      <<\n        \\relative c' {\n          cis'8 fis, bes4 <a cis>8 f bis4 |\n          cis2. <c, g'>4 |\n        }\n        \\\\\n        \\relative c' {\n          ais'2 cis, |\n          fis8 b a4 cis2 |\n        }\n      >>\n    }\n    musicB = {\n      \\clef bass\n      \\new Voice {\n        \\voiceTwo \\relative c' {\n          <fis, a cis>8[ <fis a cis>\n          \\change Staff = up\n          cis' cis\n          \\change Staff = down\n          <fis, a> <fis a>]\n          \\showStaffSwitch\n          \\change Staff = up\n          dis'4 |\n          \\change Staff = down\n          <fis, a cis>4 gis <f a d>2 |\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    \\new PianoStaff {\n      <<\n        \\context Staff = \"up\" {\n          \\accidentalStyle default\n          \\musicA\n        }\n        \\context Staff = \"down\" {\n          \\accidentalStyle default\n          \\musicB\n        }\n      >>\n    }\n\nNote that the last lines of this example can be replaced by the following, as long as the same accidental style should be used in both staves.\n\n    \\new PianoStaff {\n      <<\n        \\context Staff = \"up\" {\n          %%% change the next line as desired:\n          \\accidentalStyle Score.default\n          \\musicA\n        }\n        \\context Staff = \"down\" {\n          \\musicB\n        }\n      >>\n    }\n\ndefault\nThis is the default typesetting behavior. It corresponds to eighteenth-century common practice: accidentals are remembered to the end of the measure in which they occur and only in their own octave. Thus, in the example below, no natural signs are printed before the b in the second measure or the last c:\n\n \n\nvoice\nThe normal behavior is to remember the accidentals at Staff-level. In this style, however, accidentals are typeset individually for each voice. Apart from that, the rule is similar to default.\n\nAs a result, accidentals from one voice do not get canceled in other voices, which is often an unwanted result: in the following example, it is hard to determine whether the second a should be played natural or sharp. The voice option should therefore be used only if the voices are to be read solely by individual musicians. If the staff is to be used by one musician (e.g., a conductor or in a piano score) then modern or modern-cautionary should be used instead.\n\n \n\nmodern\nThis rule corresponds to the common practice in the twentieth century. It omits some extra natural signs, which were traditionally prefixed to a sharp following a double sharp, or a flat following a double flat. The modern rule prints the same accidentals as default, with two additions that serve to avoid ambiguity: after temporary accidentals, cancellation marks are printed also in the following measure (for notes in the same octave) and, in the same measure, for notes in other octaves. Hence the naturals before the b and the c in the second measure of the upper staff:\n\n \n\nmodern-cautionary\nThis rule is similar to modern, but the ‘extra’ accidentals (the ones not typeset by default) are typeset as cautionary accidentals. They are by default printed with parentheses, but they can also be printed in reduced size by defining the cautionary-style property of AccidentalSuggestion.\n\n \n\nmodern-voice\nThis rule is used for multivoice accidentals to be read both by musicians playing one voice and musicians playing all voices. Accidentals are typeset for each voice, but they are canceled across voices in the same Staff. Hence, the a in the last measure is canceled because the previous cancellation was in a different voice, and the d in the lower staff is canceled because of the accidental in a different voice in the previous measure:\n\n \n\nmodern-voice-cautionary\nThis rule is the same as modern-voice, but with the extra accidentals (the ones not typeset by voice) typeset as cautionaries. Even though all accidentals typeset by default are typeset with this rule, some of them are typeset as cautionaries.\n\n \n\npiano\nThis rule reflects twentieth-century practice for piano notation. Its behavior is very similar to modern style, but here accidentals also get canceled across the staves in the same GrandStaff or PianoStaff, hence all the cancellations of the final notes.\n\nThis accidental style applies to the current GrandStaff or PianoStaff by default.\n\n \n\npiano-cautionary\nThis is the same as piano but with the extra accidentals typeset as cautionaries.\n\n \n\nneo-modern\nThis rule reproduces a common practice in contemporary music: accidentals are printed like with modern, but they are printed again if the same note appears later in the same measure – except if the note is immediately repeated.\n\n \n\nneo-modern-cautionary\nThis rule is similar to neo-modern, but the extra accidentals are printed as cautionary accidentals.\n\n \n\nneo-modern-voice\nThis rule is used for multivoice accidentals to be read both by musicians playing one voice and musicians playing all voices. Accidentals are typeset for each voice as with neo-modern, but they are canceled across voices in the same Staff.\n\n \n\nneo-modern-voice-cautionary\nThis rule is similar to neo-modern-voice, but the extra accidentals are printed as cautionary accidentals.\n\n \n\ndodecaphonic\nThis rule reflects a practice introduced by composers at the beginning of the 20th century, in an attempt to abolish the hierarchy between natural and non-natural notes. With this style, every note gets an accidental sign, including natural signs.\n\n \n\nteaching\nThis rule is intended for students, and makes it easy to create scale sheets with automatically created cautionary accidentals. Accidentals are printed like with modern, but cautionary accidentals are added for all sharp or flat tones specified by the key signature, except if the note is immediately repeated.\n\n \n\nno-reset\nThis is the same as default but with accidentals lasting ‘forever’ and not only within the same measure:\n\n \n\nforget\nThis is the opposite of no-reset: Accidentals are not remembered at all – and hence all accidentals are typeset relative to the key signature, regardless of what came before in the music.\n\n \n\n",

      "When a spanner crosses a line break or breaks, each piece inherits the attributes of the original spanner. Thus, ordinary tweaking of a broken spanner applies the same modifications to each of its segments. In the example below, overriding thickness affects the slur on either side of the line break.\n\n    r2\n    \\once\\override Slur.thickness = 10\n    c8( d e f\n    \\break\n    g8 f e d) r2\n\nIndependently modifying the appearance of individual pieces of a broken spanner is possible with the \\alterBroken command. This command can produce either an \\override or a \\tweak of a spanner property.\n\nThe syntax for \\alterBroken is\n\n    [-]\\alterBroken property values item\n\nThe argument values is a list of values, one for each broken piece. If item is a grob name like Slur or Staff.PianoPedalBracket, the result is an \\override of the specified grob type. If item is a music expression such as “(” or “[” the result is the same music expression with an appropriate tweak applied.\n\nThe leading hyphen must be used with the \\tweak form. Do not add it when \\alterBroken is used as an \\override.\n\nIn its \\override usage, \\alterBroken may be prefaced by \\once or \\temporary and reverted by using \\revert with property.\n\nThe following code applies an independent \\override to each of the slur segments in the previous example:\n\n    r2\n    \\alterBroken thickness #'(10 1) Slur\n    c8( d e f\n    \\break\n    g8 f e d) r2\n\nThe \\alterBroken command may be used with any spanner object, including Tie, PhrasingSlur, Beam and TextSpanner. For example, an editor preparing a scholarly edition may wish to indicate the absence of part of a phrasing slur in a source by dashing only the segment which has been added. The following example illustrates how this can be done, in this case using the \\tweak form of the command:\n\n    % The empty list is conveniently used below, because it is the\n    % default setting of dash-definition, resulting in a solid curve.\n    c2-\\alterBroken dash-definition #'(() ((0 1.0 0.4 0.75))) \\(e\n    \\break\n    g2 e\\)\n\nIt is important to understand that \\alterBroken will set each piece of a broken spanner to the corresponding value in values. When there are fewer values than pieces, any additional piece will be assigned the empty list. This may lead to undesired results if the layout property is not set to the empty list by default. In such cases, each segment should be assigned an appropriate value.",

    detail: "Using tags",
    documentation:
      "The \\tag #'partA command marks a music expression with the name partA. Expressions tagged in this way can be selected or filtered out by name later, using either \\keepWithTag #'name or \\removeWithTag #'name. The result of applying these filters to tagged music is as follows:\n\nFilter\tResult\nTagged music preceded by \\keepWithTag #'name or \\keepWithTag #'(name1 name2…)\tUntagged music and music tagged with any of the given tag names is included; music tagged with any other tag name is excluded.\nTagged music preceded by \\removeWithTag #'name or \\removeWithTag #'(name1 name2…)\tUntagged music and music not tagged with any of the given tag names is included; music tagged with any of the given tag names is excluded.\nTagged music not preceded by either \\keepWithTag or \\removeWithTag\tAll tagged and untagged music is included.\n\n\nThe arguments of the \\tag, \\keepWithTag and \\removeWithTag commands should be a symbol (such as #'score or #'part), followed by a music expression.\n\nIn the following example, we see two versions of a piece of music, one showing trills with the usual notation, and one with trills explicitly expanded:\n\n    music = \\relative g' {\n      g8. c32 d\n      \\tag #'trills { d8.\\trill }\n      \\tag #'expand { \\repeat unfold 3 { e32 d } }\n      c32 d\n     }\n    \\score {\n      \\keepWithTag #'trills \\music\n    }\n    \\score {\n      \\keepWithTag #'expand \\music\n    }\n\nAlternatively, it is sometimes easier to exclude sections of music:\n\n    music = \\relative g' {\n      g8. c32 d\n      \\tag #'trills { d8.\\trill }\n      \\tag #'expand {\\repeat unfold 3 { e32 d } }\n      c32 d\n     }\n    \\score {\n      \\removeWithTag #'expand\n      \\music\n    }\n    \\score {\n      \\removeWithTag #'trills\n      \\music\n    }\n\nTagged filtering can be applied to articulations, texts, etc. by prepending\n\n    -\\tag #'your-tag\n\nto an articulation. For example, this would define a note with a conditional fingering indication and a note with a conditional annotation:\n\n    c1-\\tag #'finger ^4\n    c1-\\tag #'warn ^\"Watch!\"\n\nMultiple tags may be placed on expressions with multiple \\tag entries, or by combining multiple tags into one symbol list:\n\n    music = \\relative c'' {\n      \\tag #'a \\tag #'both { a4 a a a }\n      \\tag #'(b both) { b4 b b b }\n    }\n    <<\n    \\keepWithTag #'a \\music\n    \\keepWithTag #'b \\music\n    \\keepWithTag #'both \\music\n    >>\n\nMultiple \\removeWithTag filters may be applied to a single music expression to remove several differently named tagged sections. Alternatively, you can use a single \\removeWithTag with a list of tags.\n\n    music = \\relative c'' {\n      \\tag #'A { a4 a a a }\n      \\tag #'B { b4 b b b }\n      \\tag #'C { c4 c c c }\n      \\tag #'D { d4 d d d }\n    }\n    \\new Voice {\n      \\removeWithTag #'B\n      \\removeWithTag #'C\n      \\music\n      \\removeWithTag #'(B C)\n      \\music\n    }\n\nTwo or more \\keepWithTag filters applied to a single music expression will cause all tagged sections to be removed, as the first filter will remove all tagged sections except the one named, and the second filter will remove even that tagged section. Usually you would rather want to use a single \\keepWithTag command with a list of multiple tags: this will only remove tagged sections not given in any of the tags.\n\nSometimes you want to splice some music at a particular place in an existing music expression. You can use \\pushToTag and \\appendToTag for adding material at the front or end of the elements of an existing music construct. Not every music construct has elements, but sequential and simultaneous music are safe bets:\n\n    test = { \\tag #'here { \\tag #'here <<c''>> } }\n    {\n      \\pushToTag #'here c'\n      \\pushToTag #'here e'\n      \\pushToTag #'here g' \\test\n      \\appendToTag #'here c'\n      \\appendToTag #'here e'\n      \\appendToTag #'here g' \\test\n    }\n\nBoth commands get a tag, the material to splice in at every occurence of the tag, and the tagged expression. The commands make sure to copy everything that they change so that the original \\test retains its meaning.",

For example, a closing double bar line is usually placed at the end of a piece:\n\n    e4 d c2 \\bar "|."\n\nIt is not invalid if the final note in a measure does not end on the automatically entered bar line: the note is assumed to carry over into the next measure. But if a long sequence of such carry-over measures appears the music can appear compressed or even flowing off the page. This is because automatic line breaks happen only at the end of complete measures, i.e., where all notes end before the end of a measure.\n\nNote: An incorrect duration can cause line breaks to be inhibited, leading to a line of highly compressed music or music which flows off the page.\n\n',

      'Specific contexts, like Staff and Voice, are made from simple building blocks. It is possible to create new types of contexts with different combinations of engraver plug-ins.\n\nThe next example shows how to build a different type of Voice context from scratch. It will be similar to Voice, but only prints centered slash note heads. It can be used to indicate improvisation in jazz pieces,\n\nThese settings are defined within a \\context block inside a \\layout block,\n\n    \\layout {\n      \\context {\n        …\n      }\n    }\n\nIn the following discussion, the example input shown should go in place of the … in the previous fragment.\n\nFirst it is necessary to define a name for the new context:\n\n    \\name ImproVoice\n\nSince it is similar to the Voice context, we want commands that work in (existing) Voice contexts to continue working. This is achieved by giving the new context an alias of Voice,\n\n    \\alias Voice\n\nThe context will print notes and instructive texts, so we need to add the engravers which provide this functionality, plus the engraver which groups notes, stems and rests which occur at the same musical moment into columns,\n\n    \\consists "Note_heads_engraver"\n    \\consists "Text_engraver"\n    \\consists "Rhythmic_column_engraver"\n\nThe note heads should all be placed on the center line,\n\n    \\consists "Pitch_squash_engraver"\n    squashedPosition = #0\n\nThe Pitch_squash_engraver modifies note heads (created by the Note_heads_engraver) and sets their vertical position to the value of squashedPosition, in this case 0, the center line.\n\nThe notes look like a slash, and have no stem,\n\n    \\override NoteHead.style = #\'slash\n    \\hide Stem\n\nAll these plug-ins have to communicate under the control of the context. The mechanisms with which contexts communicate are established by declaring the context \\type. Within a \\layout block, most contexts will be of type Engraver_group. Some special contexts and contexts in \\midi blocks use other context types. Copying and modifying an existing context definition will also fill in the type. Since this example creates a definition from scratch, it needs to be specified explicitly.\n\n    \\type "Engraver_group"\n\nPut together, we get\n\n    \\context {\n      \\name ImproVoice\n      \\type "Engraver_group"\n      \\consists "Note_heads_engraver"\n      \\consists "Text_engraver"\n      \\consists "Rhythmic_column_engraver"\n      \\consists "Pitch_squash_engraver"\n      squashedPosition = #0\n      \\override NoteHead.style = #\'slash\n      \\hide Stem\n      \\alias Voice\n    }',

    documentation:
      'LilyPond will create lower-level contexts automatically if a music expression is encountered before a suitable context exists, but this is usually successful only for simple scores or music fragments like the ones in the documentation. For more complex scores it is advisable to specify all contexts explicitly with either the \\new or \\context command. The syntax of these two commands is very similar:\n\n    [\\new | \\context] Context [ = name] [music-expression]\n\nwhere either \\new or \\context may be specified. Context is the type of context which is to be created, name is an optional name to be given to the particular context being created and music-expression is a single music expression that is to be interpreted by the engravers and performers in this context.\n\nThe \\new prefix without a name is commonly used to create scores with many staves:\n\n    <<\n      \\new Staff {\n        % leave the Voice context to be created implicitly\n        c4 c\n      }\n      \\new Staff {\n        d4 d\n      }\n    >>\n\nand to place several voices into one staff:\n\n    <<\n      \\new Staff <<\n        \\new Voice {\n          \\voiceOne\n          c8 c c4 c c\n        }\n        \\new Voice {\n          \\voiceTwo\n          g4 g g g\n        }\n      >>\n    >>\n\n\\new should always be used to specify unnamed contexts.\n\nThe difference between \\new and \\context is in the action taken:\n\n - \\new with or without a name will always create a fresh, distinct, context, even if one with the same name already exists:\n<<\n  \\new Staff <<\n    \\new Voice = "A" {\n      \\voiceOne\n      c8 c c4 c c\n    }\n    \\new Voice = "A" {\n      \\voiceTwo\n      g4 g g g\n    }\n  >>\n>>\n \n\n\n - \\context with a name specified will create a distinct context only if a context of the same type with the same name in the same context hierarchy does not already exist. Otherwise it will be taken as a reference to that previously created context, and its music expression will be passed to that context for interpretation.\nOne application of named contexts is in separating the score layout from the musical content. Either of these two forms is valid:\n\n\\score {\n  <<\n    % score layout\n    \\new Staff <<\n      \\new Voice = "one" {\n        \\voiceOne\n      }\n      \\new Voice = "two" {\n        \\voiceTwo\n      }\n    >>\n\n    % musical content\n    \\context Voice = "one" {\n      \\relative c\'\' {\n        c4 c c c\n      }\n    }\n    \\context Voice = "two" {\n      \\relative c\'\' {\n        g8 g g4 g g\n      }\n    }\n  >>\n}\n \n\n\\score {\n  <<\n    % score layout\n    \\new Staff <<\n      \\context Voice = "one" {\n        \\voiceOne\n      }\n      \\context Voice = "two" {\n        \\voiceTwo\n      }\n    >>\n\n    % musical content\n    \\context Voice = "one" {\n      \\relative c\'\' {\n        c4 c c c\n      }\n    }\n    \\context Voice = "two" {\n      \\relative c\'\' {\n        g8 g g4 g g\n      }\n    }\n  >>\n}\n \n\nAlternatively, variables may be employed to similar effect. See Organizing pieces with variables.\n\n\n - \\context with no name will match the first of any previously created contexts of the same type in the same context heirarchy, even one that has been given a name, and its music expression will be passed to that context for interpretation. This form is rarely useful. However, \\context with no name and no music expression is used to set the context in which a Scheme procedure specified with \\applyContext is executed:\n\\new Staff \\relative c\' {\n  c1\n  \\context Timing\n  \\applyContext #(lambda (ctx)\n                   (newline)\n                   (display (ly:context-current-moment ctx)))\n  c1\n}\n\n\nA context must be named if it is to be referenced later, for example when lyrics are associated with music:\n\n    \\new Voice = "tenor" music\n    …\n    \\new Lyrics \\lyricsto "tenor" lyrics\n\nFor details of associating lyrics with music see Automatic syllable durations.\n\nThe properties of all contexts of a particular type can be modified in a \\layout block (with a different syntax), see Changing all contexts of the same type. This construct also provides a means of keeping layout instructions separate from the musical content. If a single context is to be modified, a \\with block must be used, see Changing just one specific context.',

    documentation:
      'Specific contexts, like Staff and Voice, are made from simple building blocks. It is possible to create new types of contexts with different combinations of engraver plug-ins.\n\nThe next example shows how to build a different type of Voice context from scratch. It will be similar to Voice, but only prints centered slash note heads. It can be used to indicate improvisation in jazz pieces,\n\nThese settings are defined within a \\context block inside a \\layout block,\n\n    \\layout {\n      \\context {\n        …\n      }\n    }\n\nIn the following discussion, the example input shown should go in place of the … in the previous fragment.\n\nFirst it is necessary to define a name for the new context:\n\n    \\name ImproVoice\n\nSince it is similar to the Voice context, we want commands that work in (existing) Voice contexts to continue working. This is achieved by giving the new context an alias of Voice,\n\n    \\alias Voice\n\nThe context will print notes and instructive texts, so we need to add the engravers which provide this functionality, plus the engraver which groups notes, stems and rests which occur at the same musical moment into columns,\n\n    \\consists "Note_heads_engraver"\n    \\consists "Text_engraver"\n    \\consists "Rhythmic_column_engraver"\n\nThe note heads should all be placed on the center line,\n\n    \\consists "Pitch_squash_engraver"\n    squashedPosition = #0\n\nThe Pitch_squash_engraver modifies note heads (created by the Note_heads_engraver) and sets their vertical position to the value of squashedPosition, in this case 0, the center line.\n\nThe notes look like a slash, and have no stem,\n\n    \\override NoteHead.style = #\'slash\n    \\hide Stem\n\nAll these plug-ins have to communicate under the control of the context. The mechanisms with which contexts communicate are established by declaring the context \\type. Within a \\layout block, most contexts will be of type Engraver_group. Some special contexts and contexts in \\midi blocks use other context types. Copying and modifying an existing context definition will also fill in the type. Since this example creates a definition from scratch, it needs to be specified explicitly.\n\n    \\type "Engraver_group"\n\nPut together, we get\n\n    \\context {\n      \\name ImproVoice\n      \\type "Engraver_group"\n      \\consists "Note_heads_engraver"\n      \\consists "Text_engraver"\n      \\consists "Rhythmic_column_engraver"\n      \\consists "Pitch_squash_engraver"\n      squashedPosition = #0\n      \\override NoteHead.style = #\'slash\n      \\hide Stem\n      \\alias Voice\n    }',

      "Contexts are normally positioned in a system from top to bottom in the order in which they are encountered in the input file.

Nested contexts which are not included in the outer context’s “accepts” list will be repositioned below the outer context rather than nested within it.\n\nThe “accepts” list of a context can be changed with the \\accepts or \\denies commands. \\accepts adds a context to the “accepts” list and \\denies removes a context from the list.\n\nFor example, a square-braced staff group is not usually found within a curved-braced staff with connecting staff bars, and a GrandStaff does not accept a StaffGroup inside it by default.\n\n    \\score {\n      \\new GrandStaff <<\n        \\new StaffGroup <<\n          \\new Staff { c'1 }\n          \\new Staff { d'1 }\n        >>\n        \\new Staff { \\set Staff.instrumentName = bottom f'1 }\n      >>\n    }\n\nHowever, by using the \\accepts command, StaffGroup can be added to the GrandStaff context:\n\n    \\score {\n      \\new GrandStaff <<\n        \\new StaffGroup <<\n          \\new Staff { c'1 }\n          \\new Staff { d'1 }\n        >>\n        \\new Staff { \\set Staff.instrumentName = bottom f'1 }\n      >>\n      \\layout {\n        \\context {\n          \\GrandStaff\n          \\accepts \"StaffGroup\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\n\\denies is mainly used when a new context is being based on another, but the required nesting differs. For example, the VaticanaStaff context is based on the Staff context, but with the VaticanaVoice context substituted for the Voice context in the “accepts” list.",

The general form for event-based footnotes is as follows:\n\n[direction] \\footnote [mark] offset footnote music\nTime-based footnotes\nare bound to a particular point of time in a musical context. Some commands like \\time and \\clef don’t actually use events for creating objects like time signatures and clefs.

Exactly which of a chord’s multiple note events will be deemed the root cause of a stem or flag is undefined.

It may be omitted (or equivalently replaced with \\default) in which case a number in sequence will be generated automatically. Such numerical sequences restart on each page containing a footnote.\n\noffset\nis a number pair such as ‘#(2 . 1)’ specifying the X and Y offsets in units of staff-spaces from the boundary of the object where the mark should be placed. Positive values of the offsets are taken from the right/top edge, negative values from the left/bottom edge and zero implies the mark is centered on the edge.\n\nContext\nis the context in which the grob being footnoted is created. It may be omitted if the grob is in a bottom context, e.g. a Voice context.\n\nGrobName\nspecifies a type of grob to mark (like ‘Flag’).

      "A ‘.ly’ file may contain any number of toplevel expressions, where a toplevel expression is one of the following:\n\n - An output definition, such as \\paper, \\midi, and \\layout. Such a definition at the toplevel changes the default book-wide settings. If more than one such definition of the same type is entered at the top level the definitions are combined, but in conflicting situations the later definitions take precedence. For details of how this affects the \\layout block see The \\layout block.\n - A direct scheme expression, such as #(set-default-paper-size \"a7\" 'landscape) or #(ly:set-option 'point-and-click #f).\n - A \\header block. This sets the global (i.e. the top of file) header block. This is the block containing the default settings of titling fields like composer, title, etc. for all books within the file (see Titles explained).\n - A \\score block. This score will be collected with other toplevel scores, and combined as a single \\book. This behavior can be changed by setting the variable toplevel-score-handler at toplevel. The default handler is defined in the init file ‘../scm/lily.scm’.\n - A \\book block logically combines multiple movements (i.e., multiple \\score blocks) in one document. If there are a number of \\scores, one output file will be created for each \\book block, in which all corresponding movements are concatenated. The only reason to explicitly specify \\book blocks in a ‘.ly’ file is if you wish to create multiple output files from a single input file. One exception is within lilypond-book documents, where you explicitly have to add a \\book block if you want more than a single \\score or \\markup in the same example. This behavior can be changed by setting the variable toplevel-book-handler at toplevel. The default handler is defined in the init file ‘../scm/lily.scm’.\n - A \\bookpart block. A book may be divided into several parts, using \\bookpart blocks, in order to ease the page breaking, or to use different \\paper settings in different parts.\n - A compound music expression, such as\n{ c'4 d' e'2 }\nThis will add the piece in a \\score and format it in a single book together with all other toplevel \\scores and music expressions. In other words, a file containing only the above music expression will be translated into\n\n\\book {\n  \\score {\n    \\new Staff {\n      \\new Voice {\n        { c'4 d' e'2 }\n      }\n    }\n    \\layout { }\n  }\n  \\paper { }\n  \\header { }\n}\nThis behavior can be changed by setting the variable toplevel-music-handler at toplevel. The default handler is defined in the init file ‘../scm/lily.scm’.\n\n\n - A markup text, a verse for example\n\\markup {\n   2.  The first line verse two.\n}\nMarkup texts are rendered above, between or below the scores or music expressions, wherever they appear.\n\n\n - A variable, such as\nfoo = { c4 d e d }\nThis can be used later on in the file by entering \\foo. The name of a variable should have alphabetic characters only; no numbers, underscores or dashes.\n\n\n\nThe following example shows three things that may be entered at toplevel\n\n    \\layout {\n      % Don't justify the output\n      ragged-right = ##t\n    }\n    \\header {\n       title = \"Do-re-mi\"\n    }\n    { c'4 d' e2 }\n\nAt any point in a file, any of the following lexical instructions can be entered:\n\n - \\version\n - \\include\n - \\sourcefilename\n - \\sourcefileline\n - A single-line comment, introduced by a leading % sign.\n - A multi-line comment delimited by %{ … %}.",

Distances may be specified in other units by following the quantity by \\mm, \\cm, \\in (inches), or \\pt (points, 1/72.27 of an inch). Page layout distances can also be specified in scalable units (see the following paragraph) by appending \\staff-space to the quantity. Page layout is described in detail in Page layout.\n\nScaled distances are always specified in units of the staff-space or, rarely, the half staff-space. The staff-space is the distance between two adjacent staff lines. The default value can be changed globally by setting the global staff size, or it can be overridden locally by changing the staff-space property of StaffSymbol. Scaled distances automatically scale with any change to the either the global staff size or the staff-space property of StaffSymbol, but fonts scale automatically only with changes to the global staff size. The global staff size thus enables the overall size of a rendered score to be easily varied. For the methods of setting the global staff size see Setting the staff size.",

    detail: "3.3.1 Including LilyPond files",
    documentation:
      'A large project may be split up into separate files. To refer to another file, use\n\n    \\include "otherfile.ly"\n\nThe line \\include "otherfile.ly" is equivalent to pasting the contents of ‘otherfile.ly’ into the current file at the place where the \\include appears. For example, in a large project you might write separate files for each instrument part and create a “full score” file which brings together the individual instrument files. Normally the included file will define a number of variables which then become available for use in the full score file. Tagged sections can be marked in included files to assist in making them usable in different places in a score, see Different editions from one source.\n\nFiles in the current working directory may be referenced by specifying just the file name after the \\include command. Files in other locations may be included by giving either a full path reference or a relative path reference (but use the UNIX forward slash, /, rather than the DOS/Windows back slash, \\, as the directory separator.) For example, if ‘stuff.ly’ is located one directory higher than the current working directory, use\n\n    \\include "../stuff.ly"\n\nor if the included orchestral parts files are all located in a subdirectory called ‘parts’ within the current directory, use\n\n    \\include "parts/VI.ly"\n    \\include "parts/VII.ly"\n    … etc\n\nFiles which are to be included can also contain \\include statements of their own. By default, these second-level \\include statements are not interpreted until they have been brought into the main file, so the file names they specify must all be relative to the directory containing the main file, not the directory containing the included file. However, this behavior can be changed globally by passing the option ‘-drelative-includes’ option at the command line (or by adding #(ly:set-option \'relative-includes #t) at the top of the main input file).\n\nWhen relative-includes is set to #t, the path for each \\include command will be taken relative to the file containing that command. This behavior is recommended and it will become the default behavior in a future version of lilypond.\n\nFiles relative to the main directory and files relative to some other directory may both be \\included by setting relative-includes to #t or #f at appropriate places in the files. For example, if a general library, libA, has been created which itself uses sub-files which are \\included by the entry file of that library, those \\include statements will need to be preceded by #(ly:set-option #relative-includes #t) so they are interpreted correctly when brought into the main .ly file, like this:\n\n    libA/\n      libA.ly\n      A1.ly\n      A2.ly\n      …\n\nthen the entry file, libA.ly, will contain\n\n    #(ly:set-option \'relative-includes #t)\n    \\include "A1.ly"\n    \\include "A2.ly"\n    …\n    % return to default setting\n    #(ly:set-option \'relative-includes #f)\n\nAny ‘.ly’ file can then include the entire library simply with\n\n    \\include "~/libA/libA.ly"\n\nMore complex file structures may be devised by switching at appropriate places.\n\nFiles can also be included from a directory in a search path specified as an option when invoking LilyPond from the command line. The included files are then specified using just their file name. For example, to compile ‘main.ly’ which includes files located in a subdirectory called ‘parts’ by this method, cd to the directory containing ‘main.ly’ and enter\n\n    lilypond --include=parts main.ly\n\nand in main.ly write\n\n    \\include "VI.ly"\n    \\include "VII.ly"\n    … etc\n\nFiles which are to be included in many scores may be placed in the LilyPond directory ‘../ly’. (The location of this directory is installation-dependent - see Other sources of information). These files can then be included simply by naming them on an \\include statement. This is how the language-dependent files like ‘english.ly’ are included.\n\nLilyPond includes a number of files by default when you start the program. These includes are not apparent to the user, but the files may be identified by running lilypond --verbose from the command line. This will display a list of paths and files that LilyPond uses, along with much other information. Alternatively, the more important of these files are discussed in Other sources of information. These files may be edited, but changes to them will be lost on installing a new version of LilyPond.\n\nSome simple examples of using \\include are shown in Scores and parts.',

The result of applying these filters to tagged music is as follows:\n\nFilter\tResult\nTagged music preceded by \\keepWithTag #'name or \\keepWithTag #'(name1 name2…)\tUntagged music and music tagged with any of the given tag names is included; music tagged with any other tag name is excluded.\nTagged music preceded by \\removeWithTag #'name or \\removeWithTag #'(name1 name2…)\tUntagged music and music not tagged with any of the given tag names is included; music tagged with any of the given tag names is excluded.\nTagged music not preceded by either \\keepWithTag or \\removeWithTag\tAll tagged and untagged music is included.\n\n\nThe arguments of the \\tag, \\keepWithTag and \\removeWithTag commands should be a symbol (such as #'score or #'part), followed by a music expression.\n\nIn the following example, we see two versions of a piece of music, one showing trills with the usual notation, and one with trills explicitly expanded:\n\n    music = \\relative g' {\n      g8. c32 d\n      \\tag #'trills { d8.\\trill }\n      \\tag #'expand { \\repeat unfold 3 { e32 d } }\n      c32 d\n     }\n    \\score {\n      \\keepWithTag #'trills \\music\n    }\n    \\score {\n      \\keepWithTag #'expand \\music\n    }\n\nAlternatively, it is sometimes easier to exclude sections of music:\n\n    music = \\relative g' {\n      g8. c32 d\n      \\tag #'trills { d8.\\trill }\n      \\tag #'expand {\\repeat unfold 3 { e32 d } }\n      c32 d\n     }\n    \\score {\n      \\removeWithTag #'expand\n      \\music\n    }\n    \\score {\n      \\removeWithTag #'trills\n      \\music\n    }\n\nTagged filtering can be applied to articulations, texts, etc. by prepending\n\n    -\\tag #'your-tag\n\nto an articulation. For example, this would define a note with a conditional fingering indication and a note with a conditional annotation:\n\n    c1-\\tag #'finger ^4\n    c1-\\tag #'warn ^\"Watch!\"\n\nMultiple tags may be placed on expressions with multiple \\tag entries, or by combining multiple tags into one symbol list:\n\n    music = \\relative c'' {\n      \\tag #'a \\tag #'both { a4 a a a }\n      \\tag #'(b both) { b4 b b b }\n    }\n    <<\n    \\keepWithTag #'a \\music\n    \\keepWithTag #'b \\music\n    \\keepWithTag #'both \\music\n    >>\n\nMultiple \\removeWithTag filters may be applied to a single music expression to remove several differently named tagged sections. Alternatively, you can use a single \\removeWithTag with a list of tags.\n\n    music = \\relative c'' {\n      \\tag #'A { a4 a a a }\n      \\tag #'B { b4 b b b }\n      \\tag #'C { c4 c c c }\n      \\tag #'D { d4 d d d }\n    }\n    \\new Voice {\n      \\removeWithTag #'B\n      \\removeWithTag #'C\n      \\music\n      \\removeWithTag #'(B C)\n      \\music\n    }\n\nTwo or more \\keepWithTag filters applied to a single music expression will cause all tagged sections to be removed, as the first filter will remove all tagged sections except the one named, and the second filter will remove even that tagged section. Usually you would rather want to use a single \\keepWithTag command with a list of multiple tags: this will only remove tagged sections not given in any of the tags.\n\nSometimes you want to splice some music at a particular place in an existing music expression. You can use \\pushToTag and \\appendToTag for adding material at the front or end of the elements of an existing music construct. Not every music construct has elements, but sequential and simultaneous music are safe bets:\n\n    test = { \\tag #'here { \\tag #'here <<c''>> } }\n    {\n      \\pushToTag #'here c'\n      \\pushToTag #'here e'\n      \\pushToTag #'here g' \\test\n      \\appendToTag #'here c'\n      \\appendToTag #'here e'\n      \\appendToTag #'here g' \\test\n    }\n\nBoth commands get a tag, the material to splice in at every occurence of the tag, and the tagged expression. The commands make sure to copy everything that they change so that the original \\test retains its meaning.",

      "A ‘.ly’ file may contain any number of toplevel expressions, where a toplevel expression is one of the following:\n\n - An output definition, such as \\paper, \\midi, and \\layout. Such a definition at the toplevel changes the default book-wide settings. If more than one such definition of the same type is entered at the top level the definitions are combined, but in conflicting situations the later definitions take precedence. For details of how this affects the \\layout block see The \\layout block.\n - A direct scheme expression, such as #(set-default-paper-size \"a7\" 'landscape) or #(ly:set-option 'point-and-click #f).\n - A \\header block. This sets the global (i.e. the top of file) header block. This is the block containing the default settings of titling fields like composer, title, etc. for all books within the file (see Titles explained).\n - A \\score block. This score will be collected with other toplevel scores, and combined as a single \\book. This behavior can be changed by setting the variable toplevel-score-handler at toplevel. The default handler is defined in the init file ‘../scm/lily.scm’.\n - A \\book block logically combines multiple movements (i.e., multiple \\score blocks) in one document. If there are a number of \\scores, one output file will be created for each \\book block, in which all corresponding movements are concatenated. The only reason to explicitly specify \\book blocks in a ‘.ly’ file is if you wish to create multiple output files from a single input file. One exception is within lilypond-book documents, where you explicitly have to add a \\book block if you want more than a single \\score or \\markup in the same example. This behavior can be changed by setting the variable toplevel-book-handler at toplevel. The default handler is defined in the init file ‘../scm/lily.scm’.\n - A \\bookpart block. A book may be divided into several parts, using \\bookpart blocks, in order to ease the page breaking, or to use different \\paper settings in different parts.\n - A compound music expression, such as\n{ c'4 d' e'2 }\nThis will add the piece in a \\score and format it in a single book together with all other toplevel \\scores and music expressions. In other words, a file containing only the above music expression will be translated into\n\n\\book {\n  \\score {\n    \\new Staff {\n      \\new Voice {\n        { c'4 d' e'2 }\n      }\n    }\n    \\layout { }\n  }\n  \\paper { }\n  \\header { }\n}\nThis behavior can be changed by setting the variable toplevel-music-handler at toplevel. The default handler is defined in the init file ‘../scm/lily.scm’.\n\n\n - A markup text, a verse for example\n\\markup {\n   2.  The first line verse two.\n}\nMarkup texts are rendered above, between or below the scores or music expressions, wherever they appear.\n\n\n - A variable, such as\nfoo = { c4 d e d }\nThis can be used later on in the file by entering \\foo. The name of a variable should have alphabetic characters only; no numbers, underscores or dashes.\n\n\n\nThe following example shows three things that may be entered at toplevel\n\n    \\layout {\n      % Don't justify the output\n      ragged-right = ##t\n    }\n    \\header {\n       title = \"Do-re-mi\"\n    }\n    { c'4 d' e2 }\n\nAt any point in a file, any of the following lexical instructions can be entered:\n\n - \\version\n - \\include\n - \\sourcefilename\n - \\sourcefileline\n - A single-line comment, introduced by a leading % sign.\n - A multi-line comment delimited by %{ … %}.",

    detail: "4.2.1 The \\layout block",
    documentation:
      "While the \\paper block contains settings that relate to the page formatting of the whole document, the \\layout block contains settings for score-specific layout. To set score layout options globally, enter them in a toplevel \\layout block. To set layout options for an individual score, enter them in a \\layout block inside the \\score block, after the music. Settings that can appear in a \\layout block include:\n\n - the layout-set-staff-size scheme function,\n - context modifications in \\context blocks, and\n - \\paper variables that affect score layout.\n\nThe layout-set-staff-size function is discussed in the next section, Setting the staff size. Context modifications are discussed in a separate chapter; see Modifying context plug-ins and Changing context default settings. The \\paper variables that can appear in a \\layout block are:\n\n - line-width, ragged-right and ragged-last (see \\paper variables for widths and margins)\n - indent and short-indent (see \\paper variables for shifts and indents)\n - system-count (see \\paper variables for line breaking)\n\nHere is an example \\layout block:\n\n    \\layout {\n      indent = 2\\cm\n      \\context {\n        \\StaffGroup\n        \\override StaffGrouper.staff-staff-spacing.basic-distance = #8\n      }\n      \\context {\n        \\Voice\n        \\override TextScript.padding = #1\n        \\override Glissando.thickness = #3\n      }\n    }\n\nMultiple \\layout blocks can be entered as toplevel expressions. This can, for example, be useful if different settings are stored in separate files and included optionally. Internally, when a \\layout block is evaluated, a copy of the current \\layout configuration is made, then any changes defined within the block are applied and the result is saved as the new current configuration. From the user’s perspective the \\layout blocks are combined, but in conflicting situations (when the same property is changed in different blocks) the later definitions take precedence.\n\nFor example, if this block:\n\n    \\layout {\n      \\context {\n        \\Voice\n        \\override TextScript.color = #magenta\n        \\override Glissando.thickness = #1.5\n      }\n    }\n\nis placed after the one from the preceding example the 'padding and 'color overrides for TextScript are combined, but the later 'thickness override for Glissando replaces (or hides) the earlier one.\n\n\\layout blocks may be assigned to variables for reuse later, but the way this works is slightly but significantly different from writing them literally.\n\nIf a variable is defined like this:\n\n    layoutVariable = \\layout {\n      \\context {\n        \\Voice\n        \\override NoteHead.font-size = #4\n      }\n    }\n\nit will hold the current \\layout configuration with the NoteHead.font-size override added, but this combination is not saved as the new current configuration. Be aware that the ‘current configuration’ is read when the variable is defined and not when it is used, so the content of the variable is dependent on its position in the source.\n\nThe variable can then be used inside another \\layout block, for example:\n\n    \\layout {\n      \\layoutVariable\n      \\context {\n        \\Voice\n        \\override NoteHead.color = #red\n      }\n    }\n\nA \\layout block containing a variable, as in the example above, does not copy the current configuration but instead uses the content of \\layoutVariable as the base configuration for the further additions. This means that any changes defined between the definition and the use of the variable are lost.\n\nIf layoutVariable is defined (or \\included) immediately before being used, its content is just the current configuration plus the overrides defined within it. So in the example above showing the use of \\layoutVariable the final \\layout block would consist of:\n\n      TextScript.padding = #1\n      TextScript.color = #magenta\n      Glissando.thickness = #1.5\n      NoteHead.font-size = #4\n      NoteHead.color = #red\n\nplus the indent and the StaffGrouper overrides.\n\nBut if the variable had already been defined before the first \\layout block the current configuration would now contain only\n\n      NoteHead.font-size = #4 % (written in the variable definition)\n      NoteHead.color = #red % (added after the use of the variable)\n\nIf carefully planned, \\layout variables can be a valuable tool to structure the layout design of sources, and also to reset the \\layout configuration to a known state.",

In this special input mode, the input d is not parsed as the pitch D, but rather as a one-letter syllable of text. In other words, syllables are entered like notes but with pitches replaced by text.\n\nFor example:\n\n    \\lyricmode { Three4 blind mice,2 three4 blind mice2 }\n\nThere are two main methods for specifying the horizontal placement of the syllables, either by specifying the duration of each syllable explicitly, as in the example above, or by leaving the lyrics to be aligned automatically to a melody or other voice of music, using \\addlyrics or \\lyricsto. The former method is described below in Manual syllable durations. The latter method is described in Automatic syllable durations.\n\nA word or syllable of lyrics begins with an alphabetic character (plus some other characters, see below) and is terminated by any white space or a digit. Later characters in the syllable can be any character that is not a digit or white space.\n\nBecause any character that is not a digit or white space is regarded as part of the syllable, a word is valid even if it ends with }, which often leads to the following mistake:\n\n    \\lyricmode { lah lah lah}\n\nIn this example, the } is included in the final syllable, so the opening brace is not balanced and the input file will probably not compile. Instead, braces should always be surrounded with white space:\n\n    \\lyricmode { lah lah lah }\n\nPunctuation, lyrics with accented characters, characters from non-English languages, or special characters (such as the heart symbol or slanted quotes), may simply be inserted directly into the input file, providing it is saved with UTF-8 encoding.

A word in lyrics mode is one that begins with an alphabetic character, _, ?, !, :, \', the control characters ^A through ^F, ^Q through ^W, ^Y, ^^, any 8-bit character with an ASCII code over 127, or a two-character combination of a backslash followed by one of `, \', ", or ^.\n\nGreat control over the appearance of lyrics comes from using \\markup inside the lyrics themselves.

      'Sometimes, particularly in Medieval and baroque music, several notes are sung on one syllable; this is called melisma, see melisma. The syllable to a melisma is usually left-aligned with the first note of the melisma.\n\nWhen a melisma occurs on a syllable other than the last one in a word, that syllable is usually joined to the following one with a hyphenated line. This is indicated by placing a double hyphen, --, immediately after the syllable.\n\nAlternatively, when a melisma occurs on the last or only syllable in a word an extender line is usually drawn from the end of the syllable to the last note of the melisma. This is indicated by placing a double underscore, __, immediately after the word.\n\nThere are five ways in which melismata can be indicated:\n\n - Melismata are created automatically over notes which are tied together:\n<<\n  \\new Voice = "melody" {\n    \\time 3/4\n    f4 g2 ~ |\n    g4 e2 ~ |\n    e8\n  }\n  \\new Lyrics \\lyricsto "melody" {\n    Ky -- ri -- e __\n  }\n>>\n \n\n\n - Melismata can be created automatically from the music by placing slurs over the notes of each melisma.

    documentation:
      'Sometimes, particularly in Medieval and baroque music, several notes are sung on one syllable; this is called melisma, see melisma. The syllable to a melisma is usually left-aligned with the first note of the melisma.\n\nWhen a melisma occurs on a syllable other than the last one in a word, that syllable is usually joined to the following one with a hyphenated line. This is indicated by placing a double hyphen, --, immediately after the syllable.\n\nAlternatively, when a melisma occurs on the last or only syllable in a word an extender line is usually drawn from the end of the syllable to the last note of the melisma. This is indicated by placing a double underscore, __, immediately after the word.\n\nThere are five ways in which melismata can be indicated:\n\n - Melismata are created automatically over notes which are tied together:\n<<\n  \\new Voice = "melody" {\n    \\time 3/4\n    f4 g2 ~ |\n    g4 e2 ~ |\n    e8\n  }\n  \\new Lyrics \\lyricsto "melody" {\n    Ky -- ri -- e __\n  }\n>>\n \n\n\n - Melismata can be created automatically from the music by placing slurs over the notes of each melisma.

Here, \\shiftOn is applied to move the top g out of the column, and \\mergeDifferentlyHeadedOn then works properly.\n\n    <<\n      {\n        \\mergeDifferentlyHeadedOn\n        \\mergeDifferentlyDottedOn\n        c8 d e d c d c4\n        \\shiftOn\n        g'2 fis\n      } \\\\ {\n        c2 c8. b16 c4\n        e,2 r\n      } \\\\ {\n        \\oneVoice\n        s1\n        e8 a b c d2\n      }\n    >>\n\nThe \\shiftOn command allows (but does not force) the notes in a voice to be shifted. When \\shiftOn is applied to a voice, a note or chord in that voice is shifted only if its stem would otherwise collide with a stem from another voice, and only if the colliding stems point in the same direction. The \\shiftOff command prevents this type of shifting from occurring.\n\nBy default, the outer voices (normally voices one and two) have \\shiftOff specified, while the inner voices (three and above) have \\shiftOn specified. When a shift is applied, voices with upstems (odd-numbered voices) are shifted to the right, and voices with downstems (even-numbered voices) are shifted to the left.\n\nHere is an example to help you visualize how an abbreviated polyphonic expression would be expanded internally.\n\nNote: Note that with three or more voices, the vertical order of voices in your input file should not be the same as the vertical order of voices on the staff!\n\n\n\n    \\new Staff \\relative c'' {\n      %% abbreviated entry\n      <<\n        { f2  }  % 1: highest\n        \\\\\n        { g,2 }  % 2: lowest\n        \\\\\n        { d'2 }  % 3: upper middle\n        \\\\\n        { b2  }  % 4: lower middle\n      >>\n      %% internal expansion of the above\n      <<\n        \\new Voice = \"1\" { \\voiceOne   \\shiftOff f'2 }\n        \\new Voice = \"2\" { \\voiceTwo   \\shiftOff g,2 }\n        \\new Voice = \"3\" { \\voiceThree \\shiftOn  d'2 } % shifts right\n        \\new Voice = \"4\" { \\voiceFour  \\shiftOn  b2  } % shifts left\n      >>\n    }\n\nTwo additional commands, \\shiftOnn and \\shiftOnnn provide further shift levels which may be specified temporarily to resolve collisions in complex situations – see Real music example.\n\nNotes are only merged if they have opposing stem directions (as they have, for example, in voices one and two by default or when the stems are explicitly set in opposite directions).",

If more than one such definition of the same type is entered at the top level the definitions are combined, but in conflicting situations the later definitions take precedence. For details of how this affects the \\layout block see The \\layout block.\n - A direct scheme expression, such as #(set-default-paper-size \"a7\" 'landscape) or #(ly:set-option 'point-and-click #f).\n - A \\header block. This sets the global (i.e. the top of file) header block. This is the block containing the default settings of titling fields like composer, title, etc. for all books within the file (see Titles explained).\n - A \\score block. This score will be collected with other toplevel scores, and combined as a single \\book. This behavior can be changed by setting the variable toplevel-score-handler at toplevel. The default handler is defined in the init file ‘../scm/lily.scm’.\n - A \\book block logically combines multiple movements (i.e., multiple \\score blocks) in one document. If there are a number of \\scores, one output file will be created for each \\book block, in which all corresponding movements are concatenated. The only reason to explicitly specify \\book blocks in a ‘.ly’ file is if you wish to create multiple output files from a single input file. One exception is within lilypond-book documents, where you explicitly have to add a \\book block if you want more than a single \\score or \\markup in the same example. This behavior can be changed by setting the variable toplevel-book-handler at toplevel. The default handler is defined in the init file ‘../scm/lily.scm’.\n - A \\bookpart block. A book may be divided into several parts, using \\bookpart blocks, in order to ease the page breaking, or to use different \\paper settings in different parts.\n - A compound music expression, such as\n{ c'4 d' e'2 }\nThis will add the piece in a \\score and format it in a single book together with all other toplevel \\scores and music expressions. In other words, a file containing only the above music expression will be translated into\n\n\\book {\n  \\score {\n    \\new Staff {\n      \\new Voice {\n        { c'4 d' e'2 }\n      }\n    }\n    \\layout { }\n  }\n  \\paper { }\n  \\header { }\n}\nThis behavior can be changed by setting the variable toplevel-music-handler at toplevel.

The first line verse two.\n}\nMarkup texts are rendered above, between or below the scores or music expressions, wherever they appear.\n\n\n - A variable, such as\nfoo = { c4 d e d }\nThis can be used later on in the file by entering \\foo. The name of a variable should have alphabetic characters only; no numbers, underscores or dashes.\n\n\n\nThe following example shows three things that may be entered at toplevel\n\n    \\layout {\n      % Don't justify the output\n      ragged-right = ##t\n    }\n    \\header {\n       title = \"Do-re-mi\"\n    }\n    { c'4 d' e2 }\n\nAt any point in a file, any of the following lexical instructions can be entered:\n\n - \\version\n - \\include\n - \\sourcefilename\n - \\sourcefileline\n - A single-line comment, introduced by a leading % sign.\n - A multi-line comment delimited by %{ … %}.",

    documentation:
      'LilyPond will create lower-level contexts automatically if a music expression is encountered before a suitable context exists, but this is usually successful only for simple scores or music fragments like the ones in the documentation. For more complex scores it is advisable to specify all contexts explicitly with either the \\new or \\context command. The syntax of these two commands is very similar:\n\n    [\\new | \\context] Context [ = name] [music-expression]\n\nwhere either \\new or \\context may be specified. Context is the type of context which is to be created, name is an optional name to be given to the particular context being created and music-expression is a single music expression that is to be interpreted by the engravers and performers in this context.\n\nThe \\new prefix without a name is commonly used to create scores with many staves:\n\n    <<\n      \\new Staff {\n        % leave the Voice context to be created implicitly\n        c4 c\n      }\n      \\new Staff {\n        d4 d\n      }\n    >>\n\nand to place several voices into one staff:\n\n    <<\n      \\new Staff <<\n        \\new Voice {\n          \\voiceOne\n          c8 c c4 c c\n        }\n        \\new Voice {\n          \\voiceTwo\n          g4 g g g\n        }\n      >>\n    >>\n\n\\new should always be used to specify unnamed contexts.\n\nThe difference between \\new and \\context is in the action taken:\n\n - \\new with or without a name will always create a fresh, distinct, context, even if one with the same name already exists:\n<<\n  \\new Staff <<\n    \\new Voice = "A" {\n      \\voiceOne\n      c8 c c4 c c\n    }\n    \\new Voice = "A" {\n      \\voiceTwo\n      g4 g g g\n    }\n  >>\n>>\n \n\n\n - \\context with a name specified will create a distinct context only if a context of the same type with the same name in the same context hierarchy does not already exist. Otherwise it will be taken as a reference to that previously created context, and its music expression will be passed to that context for interpretation.\nOne application of named contexts is in separating the score layout from the musical content. Either of these two forms is valid:\n\n\\score {\n  <<\n    % score layout\n    \\new Staff <<\n      \\new Voice = "one" {\n        \\voiceOne\n      }\n      \\new Voice = "two" {\n        \\voiceTwo\n      }\n    >>\n\n    % musical content\n    \\context Voice = "one" {\n      \\relative c\'\' {\n        c4 c c c\n      }\n    }\n    \\context Voice = "two" {\n      \\relative c\'\' {\n        g8 g g4 g g\n      }\n    }\n  >>\n}\n \n\n\\score {\n  <<\n    % score layout\n    \\new Staff <<\n      \\context Voice = "one" {\n        \\voiceOne\n      }\n      \\context Voice = "two" {\n        \\voiceTwo\n      }\n    >>\n\n    % musical content\n    \\context Voice = "one" {\n      \\relative c\'\' {\n        c4 c c c\n      }\n    }\n    \\context Voice = "two" {\n      \\relative c\'\' {\n        g8 g g4 g g\n      }\n    }\n  >>\n}\n \n\nAlternatively, variables may be employed to similar effect. See Organizing pieces with variables.\n\n\n - \\context with no name will match the first of any previously created contexts of the same type in the same context heirarchy, even one that has been given a name, and its music expression will be passed to that context for interpretation. This form is rarely useful. However, \\context with no name and no music expression is used to set the context in which a Scheme procedure specified with \\applyContext is executed:\n\\new Staff \\relative c\' {\n  c1\n  \\context Timing\n  \\applyContext #(lambda (ctx)\n                   (newline)\n                   (display (ly:context-current-moment ctx)))\n  c1\n}\n\n\nA context must be named if it is to be referenced later, for example when lyrics are associated with music:\n\n    \\new Voice = "tenor" music\n    …\n    \\new Lyrics \\lyricsto "tenor" lyrics\n\nFor details of associating lyrics with music see Automatic syllable durations.\n\nThe properties of all contexts of a particular type can be modified in a \\layout block (with a different syntax), see Changing all contexts of the same type. This construct also provides a means of keeping layout instructions separate from the musical content. If a single context is to be modified, a \\with block must be used, see Changing just one specific context.',

At the time of context creation, properties are initialized from the corresponding context definition and possible context modifications. Afterwards, changes are achieved with property-setting commands in the music itself.\n\nNow grob definitions are a special category of context properties. Since their structure, bookkeeping and use is different from ordinary context properties, they are accessed with a different set of commands, and treated separately in the documentation.\n\nAs opposed to plain context properties, grob definitions are subdivided into grob properties. A “grob” (graphical object) is usually created by an engraver at the time of interpreting a music expression and receives its initial properties from the current grob definition of the engraver’s context. The engraver (or other ‘backend’ parts of LilyPond) may subsequently add or change properties to the grob, but that does not affect the context’s grob definition.\n\nWhat we call ‘grob properties’ in the context of user-level tweaking are actually the properties of a context’s grob definition. In contrast to ordinary context properties, grob definitions have the bookkeeping required to keep track of its parts, the individual grob properties (and even subproperties of them) separately so that it is possible to define those parts in different contexts and have the overall grob definition at the time of grob creation be assembled from pieces provided in different contexts among the current context and its parents.\n\nGrob definitions are manipulated using \\override and \\revert and have a name starting with a capital letter (like ‘NoteHead’) whereas ordinary context properties are manipulated using \\set and \\unset and are named starting with a lowercase letter.",

Such a definition at the toplevel changes the default book-wide settings. If more than one such definition of the same type is entered at the top level the definitions are combined, but in conflicting situations the later definitions take precedence. For details of how this affects the \\layout block see The \\layout block.\n - A direct scheme expression, such as #(set-default-paper-size \"a7\" 'landscape) or #(ly:set-option 'point-and-click #f).\n - A \\header block. This sets the global (i.e. the top of file) header block. This is the block containing the default settings of titling fields like composer, title, etc. for all books within the file (see Titles explained).\n - A \\score block. This score will be collected with other toplevel scores, and combined as a single \\book. This behavior can be changed by setting the variable toplevel-score-handler at toplevel. The default handler is defined in the init file ‘../scm/lily.scm’.\n - A \\book block logically combines multiple movements (i.e., multiple \\score blocks) in one document. If there are a number of \\scores, one output file will be created for each \\book block, in which all corresponding movements are concatenated. The only reason to explicitly specify \\book blocks in a ‘.ly’ file is if you wish to create multiple output files from a single input file. One exception is within lilypond-book documents, where you explicitly have to add a \\book block if you want more than a single \\score or \\markup in the same example. This behavior can be changed by setting the variable toplevel-book-handler at toplevel. The default handler is defined in the init file ‘../scm/lily.scm’.\n - A \\bookpart block. A book may be divided into several parts, using \\bookpart blocks, in order to ease the page breaking, or to use different \\paper settings in different parts.\n - A compound music expression, such as\n{ c'4 d' e'2 }\nThis will add the piece in a \\score and format it in a single book together with all other toplevel \\scores and music expressions. In other words, a file containing only the above music expression will be translated into\n\n\\book {\n  \\score {\n    \\new Staff {\n      \\new Voice {\n        { c'4 d' e'2 }\n      }\n    }\n    \\layout { }\n  }\n  \\paper { }\n  \\header { }\n}\nThis behavior can be changed by setting the variable toplevel-music-handler at toplevel. The default handler is defined in the init file ‘../scm/lily.scm’.\n\n\n - A markup text, a verse for example\n\\markup {\n   2.  The first line verse two.\n}\nMarkup texts are rendered above, between or below the scores or music expressions, wherever they appear.\n\n\n - A variable, such as\nfoo = { c4 d e d }\nThis can be used later on in the file by entering \\foo. The name of a variable should have alphabetic characters only; no numbers, underscores or dashes.\n\n\n\nThe following example shows three things that may be entered at toplevel\n\n    \\layout {\n      % Don't justify the output\n      ragged-right = ##t\n    }\n    \\header {\n       title = \"Do-re-mi\"\n    }\n    { c'4 d' e2 }\n\nAt any point in a file, any of the following lexical instructions can be entered:\n\n - \\version\n - \\include\n - \\sourcefilename\n - \\sourcefileline\n - A single-line comment, introduced by a leading % sign.\n - A multi-line comment delimited by %{ … %}.",

For example, if the \\paper block is at the top of the file, then it will apply the paper size to all pages. If the \\paper block is inside a \\book, then the paper size will only apply to that book.\n\nWhen the set-paper-size function is used, it must be placed before any other functions used within the same \\paper block. See Automatic scaling to paper size.\n\nPaper sizes are defined in ‘scm/paper.scm’, and while it is possible to add custom sizes, they will be overwritten on subsequent software updates. The available paper sizes are listed in Predefined paper sizes.\n\nThe following command can be used in the file to add a custom paper size which can then be used with set-default-paper-size or set-paper-size as appropriate,\n\n    #(set! paper-alist (cons \'("my size" .

    documentation:
      "Automatic part combining is used to merge two separate parts of music onto a single staff. This can be especially helpful when typesetting orchestral scores. A single Voice is printed while the two parts of music are the same, but in places where they differ, a second Voice is printed. Stem directions are set up & down accordingly while Solo and a due parts are also identified and marked appropriately.\n\nThe syntax for automatic part combining is:\n\n    \\partcombine musicexpr1 musicexpr2\n\nThe following example demonstrates the basic functionality, putting parts on a single staff as polyphony and setting stem directions accordingly. The same variables are used for the independent parts and the combined staff.\n\n    instrumentOne = \\relative c' {\n      c4 d e f |\n      R1 |\n      d'4 c b a |\n      b4 g2 f4 |\n      e1 |\n    }\n    instrumentTwo = \\relative g' {\n      R1 |\n      g4 a b c |\n      d4 c b a |\n      g4 f( e) d |\n      e1 |\n    }\n    <<\n      \\new Staff \\instrumentOne\n      \\new Staff \\instrumentTwo\n      \\new Staff \\partcombine \\instrumentOne \\instrumentTwo\n    >>\n\nBoth parts have identical notes in the third measure, so only one instance of the notes is printed. Stem, slur, and tie directions are set automatically, depending on whether the parts are playing solo or in unison. When needed in polyphony situations, the first part (with context called one) gets “up” stems, while the second (called two) always gets “down” stems. In solo situations, the first and second parts get marked with “Solo” and “Solo II”, respectively. The unison (a due) parts are marked with the text “a2”.\n\nBoth arguments to \\partcombine will be interpreted as separate Voice contexts, so if the music is being specified in relative mode then both parts must contain a \\relative function, i.e.,\n\n    \\partcombine\n      \\relative … musicexpr1\n      \\relative … musicexpr2\n\nA \\relative section that encloses a \\partcombine has no effect on the pitches of musicexpr1 or musicexpr2.",

The notes of the NullVoice context do not appear on the printed page, but can be used to align the lyrics appropriately:\n\n    soprano = \\relative { b\'8( c d c) d2 }\n    alto = \\relative { g\'2 b8( a g a) }\n    aligner = \\relative { b\'8( c d c) b( a g a) }\n    words = \\lyricmode { la __ la __ }\n    \\new Staff <<\n      \\new Voice { \\voiceOne \\soprano }\n      \\new Voice { \\voiceTwo \\alto }\n      \\new NullVoice = "aligner" \\aligner\n      \\new Lyrics \\lyricsto "aligner" \\words\n    >>\n\nThe NullVoice context must be placed within a Staff context and contain notes that are already being displayed in that staff and that are also in the same octave.

The staff-space is the distance between two adjacent staff lines. The default value can be changed globally by setting the global staff size, or it can be overridden locally by changing the staff-space property of StaffSymbol. Scaled distances automatically scale with any change to the either the global staff size or the staff-space property of StaffSymbol, but fonts scale automatically only with changes to the global staff size. The global staff size thus enables the overall size of a rendered score to be easily varied. For the methods of setting the global staff size see Setting the staff size.",

      "The \\tag #'partA command marks a music expression with the name partA. Expressions tagged in this way can be selected or filtered out by name later, using either \\keepWithTag #'name or \\removeWithTag #'name. The result of applying these filters to tagged music is as follows:\n\nFilter\tResult\nTagged music preceded by \\keepWithTag #'name or \\keepWithTag #'(name1 name2…)\tUntagged music and music tagged with any of the given tag names is included; music tagged with any other tag name is excluded.\nTagged music preceded by \\removeWithTag #'name or \\removeWithTag #'(name1 name2…)\tUntagged music and music not tagged with any of the given tag names is included; music tagged with any of the given tag names is excluded.\nTagged music not preceded by either \\keepWithTag or \\removeWithTag\tAll tagged and untagged music is included.\n\n\nThe arguments of the \\tag, \\keepWithTag and \\removeWithTag commands should be a symbol (such as #'score or #'part), followed by a music expression.\n\nIn the following example, we see two versions of a piece of music, one showing trills with the usual notation, and one with trills explicitly expanded:\n\n    music = \\relative g' {\n      g8. c32 d\n      \\tag #'trills { d8.\\trill }\n      \\tag #'expand { \\repeat unfold 3 { e32 d } }\n      c32 d\n     }\n    \\score {\n      \\keepWithTag #'trills \\music\n    }\n    \\score {\n      \\keepWithTag #'expand \\music\n    }\n\nAlternatively, it is sometimes easier to exclude sections of music:\n\n    music = \\relative g' {\n      g8. c32 d\n      \\tag #'trills { d8.\\trill }\n      \\tag #'expand {\\repeat unfold 3 { e32 d } }\n      c32 d\n     }\n    \\score {\n      \\removeWithTag #'expand\n      \\music\n    }\n    \\score {\n      \\removeWithTag #'trills\n      \\music\n    }\n\nTagged filtering can be applied to articulations, texts, etc. by prepending\n\n    -\\tag #'your-tag\n\nto an articulation. For example, this would define a note with a conditional fingering indication and a note with a conditional annotation:\n\n    c1-\\tag #'finger ^4\n    c1-\\tag #'warn ^\"Watch!\"\n\nMultiple tags may be placed on expressions with multiple \\tag entries, or by combining multiple tags into one symbol list:\n\n    music = \\relative c'' {\n      \\tag #'a \\tag #'both { a4 a a a }\n      \\tag #'(b both) { b4 b b b }\n    }\n    <<\n    \\keepWithTag #'a \\music\n    \\keepWithTag #'b \\music\n    \\keepWithTag #'both \\music\n    >>\n\nMultiple \\removeWithTag filters may be applied to a single music expression to remove several differently named tagged sections. Alternatively, you can use a single \\removeWithTag with a list of tags.\n\n    music = \\relative c'' {\n      \\tag #'A { a4 a a a }\n      \\tag #'B { b4 b b b }\n      \\tag #'C { c4 c c c }\n      \\tag #'D { d4 d d d }\n    }\n    \\new Voice {\n      \\removeWithTag #'B\n      \\removeWithTag #'C\n      \\music\n      \\removeWithTag #'(B C)\n      \\music\n    }\n\nTwo or more \\keepWithTag filters applied to a single music expression will cause all tagged sections to be removed, as the first filter will remove all tagged sections except the one named, and the second filter will remove even that tagged section. Usually you would rather want to use a single \\keepWithTag command with a list of multiple tags: this will only remove tagged sections not given in any of the tags.\n\nSometimes you want to splice some music at a particular place in an existing music expression. You can use \\pushToTag and \\appendToTag for adding material at the front or end of the elements of an existing music construct. Not every music construct has elements, but sequential and simultaneous music are safe bets:\n\n    test = { \\tag #'here { \\tag #'here <<c''>> } }\n    {\n      \\pushToTag #'here c'\n      \\pushToTag #'here e'\n      \\pushToTag #'here g' \\test\n      \\appendToTag #'here c'\n      \\appendToTag #'here e'\n      \\appendToTag #'here g' \\test\n    }\n\nBoth commands get a tag, the material to splice in at every occurence of the tag, and the tagged expression. The commands make sure to copy everything that they change so that the original \\test retains its meaning.",

These are more specialized form of \\quoteDuring, see Quoting other voices in the previous section.\n\nThe syntax is:\n\n    \\cueDuring #quotename #direction #music\n\nand\n\n    \\cueDuringWithClef #quotename #direction #clef #music\n\nThe music from the corresponding measures of the quote name is added as a CueVoice context and occurs simultaneously with the music, which then creates a polyphonic situation. The direction takes the argument UP or DOWN, and corresponds to the first and second voices respectively, determining how the cue notes are printed in relation to the other voice.\n\n    fluteNotes = \\relative c\'\' {\n      r2. c4 | d8 c d e fis2 | g2 d |\n    }\n    oboeNotes = \\relative c\'\' {\n      R1\n      \\new CueVoice { \\set instrumentCueName = "flute" }\n      \\cueDuring #"flute" #UP { R1 }\n      g2 c,\n    }\n    \\addQuote "flute" { \\fluteNotes }\n    \\new Staff {\n      \\oboeNotes\n    }\n\nIt is possible to adjust which aspects of the music are quoted with \\cueDuring by setting the quotedCueEventTypes property. Its default value is \'(note-event rest-event tie-event beam-event tuplet-span-event), which means that only notes, rests, ties, beams and tuplets are quoted, but not articulations, dynamic marks, markup etc.\n\nNote: When a Voice starts with cueDuring, as in the following example, the Voice context must be explicitly declared, or else the entire music expression would belong to the CueVoice context.\n\n\n\n    oboeNotes = \\relative c\'\' {\n      r2 r8 d16(\\f f e g f a)\n      g8 g16 g g2.\n    }\n    \\addQuote "oboe" { \\oboeNotes }\n    \\new Voice \\relative c\'\' {\n      \\set Score.quotedCueEventTypes = #\'(note-event rest-event tie-event\n                                          beam-event tuplet-span-event\n                                          dynamic-event slur-event)\n      \\cueDuring #"oboe" #UP { R1 }\n      g2 c,\n    }\n\nThe name of the instrument playing the cue can be printed by setting the instrumentCueName property in a temporary CueVoice context. The placement and style of the instrumentCueName is controlled by the InstrumentSwitch object, see Instrument names. If the cue notes require a change in clef, this can be done manually but the original clef should also be restored manually at the end of the cue notes.\n\n    fluteNotes = \\relative c\'\' {\n      r2. c4 d8 c d e fis2 g2 d2\n    }\n    bassoonNotes = \\relative c {\n      \\clef bass\n      R1\n      \\clef treble\n      \\new CueVoice { \\set instrumentCueName = "flute" }\n      \\cueDuring #"flute" #UP { R1 }\n      \\clef bass\n      g4. b8 d2\n    }\n    \\addQuote "flute" { \\fluteNotes }\n    \\new Staff {\n      \\bassoonNotes\n    }\n\nAlternatively, the \\cueDuringWithClef function can be used instead.

Relative octave entry, in contrast, specifies each octave in relation to the last note: changing one note’s octave will affect all of the following notes.\n\nRelative note mode has to be entered explicitly using the \\relative command:\n\n    \\relative startpitch musicexpr\n\nIn relative mode, each note is assumed to be as close to the previous note as possible. This means that the octave of each pitch inside musicexpr is calculated as follows:\n\n - If no octave changing mark is used on a pitch, its octave is calculated so that the interval with the previous note is less than a fifth. This interval is determined without considering accidentals.\n - An octave changing mark ' or , can be added to respectively raise or lower a pitch by an extra octave, relative to the pitch calculated without an octave mark.\n - Multiple octave changing marks can be used. For example, '' and ,, will alter the pitch by two octaves.\n - The pitch of the first note is relative to startpitch. startpitch is specified in absolute octave mode.

      "The \\tag #'partA command marks a music expression with the name partA.

The result of applying these filters to tagged music is as follows:\n\nFilter\tResult\nTagged music preceded by \\keepWithTag #'name or \\keepWithTag #'(name1 name2…)\tUntagged music and music tagged with any of the given tag names is included; music tagged with any other tag name is excluded.\nTagged music preceded by \\removeWithTag #'name or \\removeWithTag #'(name1 name2…)\tUntagged music and music not tagged with any of the given tag names is included; music tagged with any of the given tag names is excluded.\nTagged music not preceded by either \\keepWithTag or \\removeWithTag\tAll tagged and untagged music is included.\n\n\nThe arguments of the \\tag, \\keepWithTag and \\removeWithTag commands should be a symbol (such as #'score or #'part), followed by a music expression.\n\nIn the following example, we see two versions of a piece of music, one showing trills with the usual notation, and one with trills explicitly expanded:\n\n    music = \\relative g' {\n      g8. c32 d\n      \\tag #'trills { d8.\\trill }\n      \\tag #'expand { \\repeat unfold 3 { e32 d } }\n      c32 d\n     }\n    \\score {\n      \\keepWithTag #'trills \\music\n    }\n    \\score {\n      \\keepWithTag #'expand \\music\n    }\n\nAlternatively, it is sometimes easier to exclude sections of music:\n\n    music = \\relative g' {\n      g8. c32 d\n      \\tag #'trills { d8.\\trill }\n      \\tag #'expand {\\repeat unfold 3 { e32 d } }\n      c32 d\n     }\n    \\score {\n      \\removeWithTag #'expand\n      \\music\n    }\n    \\score {\n      \\removeWithTag #'trills\n      \\music\n    }\n\nTagged filtering can be applied to articulations, texts, etc. by prepending\n\n    -\\tag #'your-tag\n\nto an articulation. For example, this would define a note with a conditional fingering indication and a note with a conditional annotation:\n\n    c1-\\tag #'finger ^4\n    c1-\\tag #'warn ^\"Watch!\"\n\nMultiple tags may be placed on expressions with multiple \\tag entries, or by combining multiple tags into one symbol list:\n\n    music = \\relative c'' {\n      \\tag #'a \\tag #'both { a4 a a a }\n      \\tag #'(b both) { b4 b b b }\n    }\n    <<\n    \\keepWithTag #'a \\music\n    \\keepWithTag #'b \\music\n    \\keepWithTag #'both \\music\n    >>\n\nMultiple \\removeWithTag filters may be applied to a single music expression to remove several differently named tagged sections. Alternatively, you can use a single \\removeWithTag with a list of tags.\n\n    music = \\relative c'' {\n      \\tag #'A { a4 a a a }\n      \\tag #'B { b4 b b b }\n      \\tag #'C { c4 c c c }\n      \\tag #'D { d4 d d d }\n    }\n    \\new Voice {\n      \\removeWithTag #'B\n      \\removeWithTag #'C\n      \\music\n      \\removeWithTag #'(B C)\n      \\music\n    }\n\nTwo or more \\keepWithTag filters applied to a single music expression will cause all tagged sections to be removed, as the first filter will remove all tagged sections except the one named, and the second filter will remove even that tagged section. Usually you would rather want to use a single \\keepWithTag command with a list of multiple tags: this will only remove tagged sections not given in any of the tags.\n\nSometimes you want to splice some music at a particular place in an existing music expression. You can use \\pushToTag and \\appendToTag for adding material at the front or end of the elements of an existing music construct. Not every music construct has elements, but sequential and simultaneous music are safe bets:\n\n    test = { \\tag #'here { \\tag #'here <<c''>> } }\n    {\n      \\pushToTag #'here c'\n      \\pushToTag #'here e'\n      \\pushToTag #'here g' \\test\n      \\appendToTag #'here c'\n      \\appendToTag #'here e'\n      \\appendToTag #'here g' \\test\n    }\n\nBoth commands get a tag, the material to splice in at every occurence of the tag, and the tagged expression. The commands make sure to copy everything that they change so that the original \\test retains its meaning.",

      "A ‘.ly’ file may contain any number of toplevel expressions, where a toplevel expression is one of the following:\n\n - An output definition, such as \\paper, \\midi, and \\layout. Such a definition at the toplevel changes the default book-wide settings. If more than one such definition of the same type is entered at the top level the definitions are combined, but in conflicting situations the later definitions take precedence. For details of how this affects the \\layout block see The \\layout block.\n - A direct scheme expression, such as #(set-default-paper-size \"a7\" 'landscape) or #(ly:set-option 'point-and-click #f).\n - A \\header block. This sets the global (i.e. the top of file) header block. This is the block containing the default settings of titling fields like composer, title, etc. for all books within the file (see Titles explained).\n - A \\score block. This score will be collected with other toplevel scores, and combined as a single \\book. This behavior can be changed by setting the variable toplevel-score-handler at toplevel. The default handler is defined in the init file ‘../scm/lily.scm’.\n - A \\book block logically combines multiple movements (i.e., multiple \\score blocks) in one document. If there are a number of \\scores, one output file will be created for each \\book block, in which all corresponding movements are concatenated. The only reason to explicitly specify \\book blocks in a ‘.ly’ file is if you wish to create multiple output files from a single input file. One exception is within lilypond-book documents, where you explicitly have to add a \\book block if you want more than a single \\score or \\markup in the same example. This behavior can be changed by setting the variable toplevel-book-handler at toplevel. The default handler is defined in the init file ‘../scm/lily.scm’.\n - A \\bookpart block. A book may be divided into several parts, using \\bookpart blocks, in order to ease the page breaking, or to use different \\paper settings in different parts.\n - A compound music expression, such as\n{ c'4 d' e'2 }\nThis will add the piece in a \\score and format it in a single book together with all other toplevel \\scores and music expressions. In other words, a file containing only the above music expression will be translated into\n\n\\book {\n  \\score {\n    \\new Staff {\n      \\new Voice {\n        { c'4 d' e'2 }\n      }\n    }\n    \\layout { }\n  }\n  \\paper { }\n  \\header { }\n}\nThis behavior can be changed by setting the variable toplevel-music-handler at toplevel. The default handler is defined in the init file ‘../scm/lily.scm’.\n\n\n - A markup text, a verse for example\n\\markup {\n   2.  The first line verse two.\n}\nMarkup texts are rendered above, between or below the scores or music expressions, wherever they appear.\n\n\n - A variable, such as\nfoo = { c4 d e d }\nThis can be used later on in the file by entering \\foo. The name of a variable should have alphabetic characters only; no numbers, underscores or dashes.\n\n\n\nThe following example shows three things that may be entered at toplevel\n\n    \\layout {\n      % Don't justify the output\n      ragged-right = ##t\n    }\n    \\header {\n       title = \"Do-re-mi\"\n    }\n    { c'4 d' e2 }\n\nAt any point in a file, any of the following lexical instructions can be entered:\n\n - \\version\n - \\include\n - \\sourcefilename\n - \\sourcefileline\n - A single-line comment, introduced by a leading % sign.\n - A multi-line comment delimited by %{ … %}.",

Context properties are changed with the \\set command, which has the following syntax:\n\n    \\set context.property = #value\n\nvalue is a Scheme object, which is why it must be preceded by the # character.\n\nContexts properties are usually named in studlyCaps. They mostly control the translation from music to notation, e.g. localKeySignature (for determining whether to print accidentals), or measurePosition (for determining when to print a bar line). Context properties can change value over time while interpreting a piece of music; measurePosition is an obvious example of this. Context properties are modified with \\set.\n\nFor example, multimeasure rests will be combined into a single bar if the context property skipBars is set to #t:\n\n    R1*2\n    \\set Score.skipBars = ##t\n    R1*2\n\nIf the context argument is left out, then the property will be set in the current bottom context (typically ChordNames, Voice, TabVoice, or Lyrics).\n\n    \\set Score.autoBeaming = ##f\n    <<\n      {\n        e8 e e e\n        \\set autoBeaming = ##t\n        e8 e e e\n      } \\\\ {\n        c8 c c c c8 c c c\n      }\n    >>\n\nThe change is applied ‘on-the-fly’, during the music, so that the setting only affects the second group of eighth notes.\n\nNote that the bottom-most context does not always contain the property that you wish to change – for example, attempting to set the skipBars property of the default bottom context, in this case Voice, will have no effect, because skipBars is a property of the Score context.\n\n    R1*2\n    \\set skipBars = ##t\n    R1*2\n\nContexts are hierarchical, so if an enclosing context was specified, for example Staff, then the change would also apply to all Voices in the current staff.",

      "Both \\set and \\override manipulate properties associated with contexts. In either case, properties heed the hierarchy of contexts: properties not set in a context itself show the values of the respective parent context.\n\nValues and lifetime of context properties are dynamic and only available when music is being interpreted, ‘iterated’. At the time of context creation, properties are initialized from the corresponding context definition and possible context modifications. Afterwards, changes are achieved with property-setting commands in the music itself.\n\nNow grob definitions are a special category of context properties. Since their structure, bookkeeping and use is different from ordinary context properties, they are accessed with a different set of commands, and treated separately in the documentation.\n\nAs opposed to plain context properties, grob definitions are subdivided into grob properties. A “grob” (graphical object) is usually created by an engraver at the time of interpreting a music expression and receives its initial properties from the current grob definition of the engraver’s context. The engraver (or other ‘backend’ parts of LilyPond) may subsequently add or change properties to the grob, but that does not affect the context’s grob definition.\n\nWhat we call ‘grob properties’ in the context of user-level tweaking are actually the properties of a context’s grob definition. In contrast to ordinary context properties, grob definitions have the bookkeeping required to keep track of its parts, the individual grob properties (and even subproperties of them) separately so that it is possible to define those parts in different contexts and have the overall grob definition at the time of grob creation be assembled from pieces provided in different contexts among the current context and its parents.\n\nGrob definitions are manipulated using \\override and \\revert and have a name starting with a capital letter (like ‘NoteHead’) whereas ordinary context properties are manipulated using \\set and \\unset and are named starting with a lowercase letter.",

      "In this example the automatic placement of the tie is not optimum, and \\tieDown would not help.\n\n    <<\n      { e1~ e }\n    \\\\\n      { r4 <g c,> <g c,> <g c,> }\n    >>\n\nAdjusting the control points of the tie with \\shape allows the collisions to be avoided.\n\nThe syntax of \\shape is\n\n    [-]\\shape displacements item\n\nThis will reposition the control-points of item by the amounts given by displacements. The displacements argument is a list of number pairs or a list of such lists. Each element of a pair represents the displacement of one of the coordinates of a control-point. If item is a string, the result is \\once\\override for the specified grob type. If item is a music expression, the result is the same music expression with an appropriate tweak applied.\n\nIn other words, the \\shape function can act as either a \\once\\override command or a \\tweak command depending on whether the item argument is a grob name, like “Slur”, or a music expression, like “(”. The displacements argument specifies the displacements of the four control points as a list of four pairs of (dx . dy) values in units of staff-spaces (or a list of such lists if the curve has more than one segment).\n\nThe leading hyphen is required if and only if the \\tweak form is being used.\n\nSo, using the same example as above and the \\once\\override form of \\shape, this will raise the tie by half a staff-space:\n\n    <<\n      {\n        \\shape #'((0 . 0.5) (0 . 0.5) (0 . 0.5) (0 . 0.5)) Tie\n        e1~ e\n      }\n    \\\\\n      { r4 <g c,> <g c,> <g c,> }\n    >>\n\nThis positioning of the tie is better, but maybe it should be raised more in the center. The following example does this, this time using the alternative \\tweak form:\n\n    <<\n      {\n        e1-\\shape #'((0 . 0.5) (0 . 1) (0 . 1) (0 . 0.5)) ~ e\n      }\n    \\\\\n      { r4 <g c,> <g c,> <g c,> }\n    >>\n\nChanges to the horizontal positions of the control points may be made in the same way, and two different curves starting at the same musical moment may also be shaped:\n\n    c8(\\( a) a'4 e c\\)\n    \\shape #'((0.7 . -0.4) (0.5 . -0.4) (0.3 . -0.3) (0 . -0.2)) Slur\n    \\shape #'((0 . 0) (0 . 0.5) (0 . 0.5) (0 . 0)) PhrasingSlur\n    c8(\\( a) a'4 e c\\)\n\nThe \\shape function can also displace the control points of curves which stretch across line breaks. Each piece of the broken curve can be given its own list of offsets. If changes to a particular segment are not needed, the empty list can serve as a placeholder. In this example the line break makes the single slur look like two:\n\n    c4( f g c\n    \\break\n    d,4 c' f, c)\n\nChanging the shapes of the two halves of the slur makes it clearer that the slur continues over the line break:\n\n    % () may be used as a shorthand for ((0 . 0) (0 . 0) (0 . 0) (0 . 0))\n    % if any of the segments does not need to be changed\n    \\shape #'(\n               (( 0 . 0) (0 . 0) (0 . 0) (0 . 1))\n               ((0.5 . 1.5) (1 . 0) (0 . 0) (0 . -1.5))\n             ) Slur\n    c4( f g c\n    \\break\n    d,4 c' f, c)\n\nIf an S-shaped curve is required the control points must always be adjusted manually — LilyPond will never select such shapes automatically.\n\n    c8( e b-> f d' a e-> g)\n    \\shape #'((0 . -1) (5.5 . -0.5) (-5.5 . -10.5) (0 . -5.5)) PhrasingSlur\n    c8\\( e b-> f d' a e-> g\\)",

The \\shiftOff command prevents this type of shifting from occurring.\n\nBy default, the outer voices (normally voices one and two) have \\shiftOff specified, while the inner voices (three and above) have \\shiftOn specified. When a shift is applied, voices with upstems (odd-numbered voices) are shifted to the right, and voices with downstems (even-numbered voices) are shifted to the left.\n\nHere is an example to help you visualize how an abbreviated polyphonic expression would be expanded internally.\n\nNote: Note that with three or more voices, the vertical order of voices in your input file should not be the same as the vertical order of voices on the staff!\n\n\n\n    \\new Staff \\relative c'' {\n      %% abbreviated entry\n      <<\n        { f2  }  % 1: highest\n        \\\\\n        { g,2 }  % 2: lowest\n        \\\\\n        { d'2 }  % 3: upper middle\n        \\\\\n        { b2  }  % 4: lower middle\n      >>\n      %% internal expansion of the above\n      <<\n        \\new Voice = \"1\" { \\voiceOne   \\shiftOff f'2 }\n        \\new Voice = \"2\" { \\voiceTwo   \\shiftOff g,2 }\n        \\new Voice = \"3\" { \\voiceThree \\shiftOn  d'2 } % shifts right\n        \\new Voice = \"4\" { \\voiceFour  \\shiftOn  b2  } % shifts left\n      >>\n    }\n\nTwo additional commands, \\shiftOnn and \\shiftOnnn provide further shift levels which may be specified temporarily to resolve collisions in complex situations – see Real music example.\n\nNotes are only merged if they have opposing stem directions (as they have, for example, in voices one and two by default or when the stems are explicitly set in opposite directions).",

    detail: "Using tags",
    documentation:
      "The \\tag #'partA command marks a music expression with the name partA. Expressions tagged in this way can be selected or filtered out by name later, using either \\keepWithTag #'name or \\removeWithTag #'name. The result of applying these filters to tagged music is as follows:\n\nFilter\tResult\nTagged music preceded by \\keepWithTag #'name or \\keepWithTag #'(name1 name2…)\tUntagged music and music tagged with any of the given tag names is included; music tagged with any other tag name is excluded.\nTagged music preceded by \\removeWithTag #'name or \\removeWithTag #'(name1 name2…)\tUntagged music and music not tagged with any of the given tag names is included; music tagged with any of the given tag names is excluded.\nTagged music not preceded by either \\keepWithTag or \\removeWithTag\tAll tagged and untagged music is included.\n\n\nThe arguments of the \\tag, \\keepWithTag and \\removeWithTag commands should be a symbol (such as #'score or #'part), followed by a music expression.\n\nIn the following example, we see two versions of a piece of music, one showing trills with the usual notation, and one with trills explicitly expanded:\n\n    music = \\relative g' {\n      g8. c32 d\n      \\tag #'trills { d8.\\trill }\n      \\tag #'expand { \\repeat unfold 3 { e32 d } }\n      c32 d\n     }\n    \\score {\n      \\keepWithTag #'trills \\music\n    }\n    \\score {\n      \\keepWithTag #'expand \\music\n    }\n\nAlternatively, it is sometimes easier to exclude sections of music:\n\n    music = \\relative g' {\n      g8. c32 d\n      \\tag #'trills { d8.\\trill }\n      \\tag #'expand {\\repeat unfold 3 { e32 d } }\n      c32 d\n     }\n    \\score {\n      \\removeWithTag #'expand\n      \\music\n    }\n    \\score {\n      \\removeWithTag #'trills\n      \\music\n    }\n\nTagged filtering can be applied to articulations, texts, etc. by prepending\n\n    -\\tag #'your-tag\n\nto an articulation. For example, this would define a note with a conditional fingering indication and a note with a conditional annotation:\n\n    c1-\\tag #'finger ^4\n    c1-\\tag #'warn ^\"Watch!\"\n\nMultiple tags may be placed on expressions with multiple \\tag entries, or by combining multiple tags into one symbol list:\n\n    music = \\relative c'' {\n      \\tag #'a \\tag #'both { a4 a a a }\n      \\tag #'(b both) { b4 b b b }\n    }\n    <<\n    \\keepWithTag #'a \\music\n    \\keepWithTag #'b \\music\n    \\keepWithTag #'both \\music\n    >>\n\nMultiple \\removeWithTag filters may be applied to a single music expression to remove several differently named tagged sections. Alternatively, you can use a single \\removeWithTag with a list of tags.\n\n    music = \\relative c'' {\n      \\tag #'A { a4 a a a }\n      \\tag #'B { b4 b b b }\n      \\tag #'C { c4 c c c }\n      \\tag #'D { d4 d d d }\n    }\n    \\new Voice {\n      \\removeWithTag #'B\n      \\removeWithTag #'C\n      \\music\n      \\removeWithTag #'(B C)\n      \\music\n    }\n\nTwo or more \\keepWithTag filters applied to a single music expression will cause all tagged sections to be removed, as the first filter will remove all tagged sections except the one named, and the second filter will remove even that tagged section. Usually you would rather want to use a single \\keepWithTag command with a list of multiple tags: this will only remove tagged sections not given in any of the tags.\n\nSometimes you want to splice some music at a particular place in an existing music expression. You can use \\pushToTag and \\appendToTag for adding material at the front or end of the elements of an existing music construct. Not every music construct has elements, but sequential and simultaneous music are safe bets:\n\n    test = { \\tag #'here { \\tag #'here <<c''>> } }\n    {\n      \\pushToTag #'here c'\n      \\pushToTag #'here e'\n      \\pushToTag #'here g' \\test\n      \\appendToTag #'here c'\n      \\appendToTag #'here e'\n      \\appendToTag #'here g' \\test\n    }\n\nBoth commands get a tag, the material to splice in at every occurence of the tag, and the tagged expression. The commands make sure to copy everything that they change so that the original \\test retains its meaning.",

For example, you could write \\taor instead of\n\n    \\grace { \\small G32[ d G e] }\n\n‘bagpipe.ly’ also contains pitch definitions for the bagpipe notes in the appropriate octaves, so you do not need to worry about \\relative or \\transpose.\n\n    \\include "bagpipe.ly"\n    { \\grg G4 \\grg a \\grg b \\grg c \\grg d \\grg e \\grg f \\grA g A }\n\nBagpipe music nominally uses the key of D Major (even though that isn’t really true). However, since that is the only key that can be used, the key signature is normally not written out. To set this up correctly, always start your music with \\hideKeySignature. If you for some reason want to show the key signature, you can use \\showKeySignature instead.\n\nSome modern music use cross fingering on c and f to flatten those notes. This can be indicated by cflat or fflat. Similarly, the piobaireachd high g can be written gflat when it occurs in light music.',

It will be similar to Voice, but only prints centered slash note heads.

      '\\markup commands in the \\header block are useful for simple text formatting, but they do not allow precise control over the placement of titles. To customize the placement of the text fields, change either or both of the following \\paper variables:\n\n - bookTitleMarkup\n - scoreTitleMarkup\n\nThe placement of titles when using the default values of these \\markup variables is shown in the examples in Default layout of bookpart and score titles.\n\nThe default settings for scoreTitleMarkup as defined in ‘ly/titling-init.ly’ are:\n\n    scoreTitleMarkup = \\markup { \\column {\n      \\on-the-fly \\print-all-headers { \\bookTitleMarkup \\hspace #1 }\n      \\fill-line {\n        \\fromproperty #\'header:piece\n        \\fromproperty #\'header:opus\n      }\n    }\n    }\n\nThis places the piece and opus text fields at opposite ends of the same line:\n\n    \\score {\n      { s1 }\n      \\header {\n        piece = "PRAELUDIUM I"\n        opus = "BWV 846"\n      }\n    }\n\nThis example redefines scoreTitleMarkup so that the piece text field is centered and in a large, bold font.\n\n    \\book {\n      \\paper {\n        indent = 0\\mm\n        scoreTitleMarkup = \\markup {\n          \\fill-line {\n            \\null\n            \\fontsize #4 \\bold \\fromproperty #\'header:piece\n            \\fromproperty #\'header:opus\n          }\n        }\n      }\n      \\header { tagline = ##f }\n      \\score {\n        { s1 }\n        \\header {\n          piece = "PRAELUDIUM I"\n          opus = "BWV 846"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\nText fields not normally effective in score \\header blocks can be printed in the Score Title area if print-all-headers is placed inside the \\paper block. A disadvantage of using this method is that text fields that are intended specifically for the Bookpart Title area need to be manually suppressed in every \\score block. See Titles explained.\n\nTo avoid this, add the desired text field to the scoreTitleMarkup definition. In the following example, the composer text field (normally associated with bookTitleMarkup) is added to scoreTitleMarkup, allowing each score to list a different composer:\n\n    \\book {\n      \\paper {\n        indent = 0\\mm\n        scoreTitleMarkup = \\markup {\n          \\fill-line {\n            \\null\n            \\fontsize #4 \\bold \\fromproperty #\'header:piece\n            \\fromproperty #\'header:composer\n          }\n        }\n      }\n      \\header { tagline = ##f }\n      \\score {\n        { s1 }\n        \\header {\n          piece = "MENUET"\n          composer = "Christian Petzold"\n        }\n      }\n      \\score {\n        { s1 }\n        \\header {\n          piece = "RONDEAU"\n          composer = "François Couperin"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\nIt is also possible to create your own custom text fields, and refer to them in the markup definition.\n\n    \\book {\n      \\paper {\n        indent = 0\\mm\n        scoreTitleMarkup = \\markup {\n          \\fill-line {\n            \\null\n            \\override #`(direction . ,UP) {\n              \\dir-column {\n                \\center-align \\fontsize #-1 \\bold\n                  \\fromproperty #\'header:mycustomtext %% User-defined field\n                \\center-align \\fontsize #4 \\bold\n                  \\fromproperty #\'header:piece\n              }\n            }\n            \\fromproperty #\'header:opus\n          }\n        }\n      }\n      \\header { tagline = ##f }\n      \\score {\n        { s1 }\n        \\header {\n          piece = "FUGA I"\n          mycustomtext = "A 4 VOCI" %% User-defined field\n          opus = "BWV 846"\n        }\n      }\n    }',

The transformation from pitch to letter is done by this function. Special note names (for example, the German ‘H’ for a B-chord) can be produced by storing a new function in this property.\n\nmajorSevenSymbol\nThis property contains the markup object used to follow the output of chordRootNamer to identify a major 7 chord. Predefined options are whiteTriangleMarkup and blackTriangleMarkup.\n\nadditionalPitchPrefix\nWhen the chord name contains additional pitches, they can optionally be prefixed with some text. The default is no prefix, in order to avoid too much visual clutter, but for small numbers of additional pitches this can be visually effective.\n\n\\new ChordNames {\n  <c e g d\'>    % add9\n  \\set additionalPitchPrefix = #"add"\n  <c e g d\'>    % add9\n}\n \n\nchordNoteNamer\nWhen the chord name contains additional pitches other than the root (e.g., an added bass note), this function is used to print the additional pitch. By default the pitch is printed using chordRootNamer. The chordNoteNamer property can be set to a specialized function to change this behavior. For example, the bass note can be printed in lower case.\n\nchordNameSeparator\nDifferent parts of a chord name are normally separated by a small amount of horizontal space. By setting chordNameSeparator, you can use any desired markup for a separator. This does not affect the separator between a chord and its bass note; to customize that, use slashChordSeparator.\n\n\\chords {\n  c4:7.9- c:7.9-/g\n  \\set chordNameSeparator = \\markup { "/" }\n  \\break\n  c4:7.9- c:7.9-/g\n}\n \n\nslashChordSeparator\nChords can be played over a bass note other than the conventional root of the chord. These are known as “inversions” or “slash chords”, because the default way of notating them is with a forward slash between the main chord and the bass note. Therefore the value of slashChordSeparator defaults to a forward slash, but you can change it to any markup you choose.\n\n\\chords {\n  c4:7.9- c:7.9-/g\n  \\set slashChordSeparator = \\markup { " over " }\n  \\break\n  c4:7.9- c:7.9-/g\n}\n \n\nchordNameExceptions\nThis property is a list of pairs. The first item in each pair is a set of pitches used to identify the steps present in the chord. The second item is a markup that will follow the chordRootNamer output to create the chord name.\n\nminorChordModifier\nMinor chords are often denoted via a ‘m’ suffix to the right of the root of the chord. However some idioms prefer other suffices, such as a minus sign.\n\n\\chords {\n  c4:min f:min7\n  \\set minorChordModifier = \\markup { "-" }\n  \\break\n  c4:min f:min7\n}\n \n\nchordPrefixSpacer\nThe modifier for minor chords as determined by minorChordModifier is usually printed immediately to the right of the root of the chord. A spacer can be placed between the root and the modifier by setting chordPrefixSpacer. The spacer is not used when the root is altered.\n\n',

    detail: "Automatic accidentals",

      "There are many different conventions on how to typeset accidentals. LilyPond provides a function to specify which accidental style to use. This function is called as follows:\n\n    \\new Staff <<\n      \\accidentalStyle voice\n      { … }\n    >>\n\nThe accidental style applies to the current Staff by default (with the exception of the styles piano and piano-cautionary, which are explained below). Optionally, the function can take a second argument that determines in which scope the style should be changed. For example, to use the same style in all staves of the current StaffGroup, use:\n\n    \\accidentalStyle StaffGroup.voice\n\nThe following accidental styles are supported. To demonstrate each style, we use the following example:\n\n    musicA = {\n      <<\n        \\relative c' {\n          cis'8 fis, bes4 <a cis>8 f bis4 |\n          cis2. <c, g'>4 |\n        }\n        \\\\\n        \\relative c' {\n          ais'2 cis, |\n          fis8 b a4 cis2 |\n        }\n      >>\n    }\n    musicB = {\n      \\clef bass\n      \\new Voice {\n        \\voiceTwo \\relative c' {\n          <fis, a cis>8[ <fis a cis>\n          \\change Staff = up\n          cis' cis\n          \\change Staff = down\n          <fis, a> <fis a>]\n          \\showStaffSwitch\n          \\change Staff = up\n          dis'4 |\n          \\change Staff = down\n          <fis, a cis>4 gis <f a d>2 |\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    \\new PianoStaff {\n      <<\n        \\context Staff = \"up\" {\n          \\accidentalStyle default\n          \\musicA\n        }\n        \\context Staff = \"down\" {\n          \\accidentalStyle default\n          \\musicB\n        }\n      >>\n    }\n\nNote that the last lines of this example can be replaced by the following, as long as the same accidental style should be used in both staves.\n\n    \\new PianoStaff {\n      <<\n        \\context Staff = \"up\" {\n          %%% change the next line as desired:\n          \\accidentalStyle Score.default\n          \\musicA\n        }\n        \\context Staff = \"down\" {\n          \\musicB\n        }\n      >>\n    }\n\ndefault\nThis is the default typesetting behavior. It corresponds to eighteenth-century common practice: accidentals are remembered to the end of the measure in which they occur and only in their own octave. Thus, in the example below, no natural signs are printed before the b in the second measure or the last c:\n\n \n\nvoice\nThe normal behavior is to remember the accidentals at Staff-level. In this style, however, accidentals are typeset individually for each voice. Apart from that, the rule is similar to default.\n\nAs a result, accidentals from one voice do not get canceled in other voices, which is often an unwanted result: in the following example, it is hard to determine whether the second a should be played natural or sharp. The voice option should therefore be used only if the voices are to be read solely by individual musicians. If the staff is to be used by one musician (e.g., a conductor or in a piano score) then modern or modern-cautionary should be used instead.\n\n \n\nmodern\nThis rule corresponds to the common practice in the twentieth century. It omits some extra natural signs, which were traditionally prefixed to a sharp following a double sharp, or a flat following a double flat. The modern rule prints the same accidentals as default, with two additions that serve to avoid ambiguity: after temporary accidentals, cancellation marks are printed also in the following measure (for notes in the same octave) and, in the same measure, for notes in other octaves. Hence the naturals before the b and the c in the second measure of the upper staff:\n\n \n\nmodern-cautionary\nThis rule is similar to modern, but the ‘extra’ accidentals (the ones not typeset by default) are typeset as cautionary accidentals. They are by default printed with parentheses, but they can also be printed in reduced size by defining the cautionary-style property of AccidentalSuggestion.\n\n \n\nmodern-voice\nThis rule is used for multivoice accidentals to be read both by musicians playing one voice and musicians playing all voices. Accidentals are typeset for each voice, but they are canceled across voices in the same Staff. Hence, the a in the last measure is canceled because the previous cancellation was in a different voice, and the d in the lower staff is canceled because of the accidental in a different voice in the previous measure:\n\n \n\nmodern-voice-cautionary\nThis rule is the same as modern-voice, but with the extra accidentals (the ones not typeset by voice) typeset as cautionaries.

Accidentals are typeset for each voice as with neo-modern, but they are canceled across voices in the same Staff.\n\n \n\nneo-modern-voice-cautionary\nThis rule is similar to neo-modern-voice, but the extra accidentals are printed as cautionary accidentals.\n\n \n\ndodecaphonic\nThis rule reflects a practice introduced by composers at the beginning of the 20th century, in an attempt to abolish the hierarchy between natural and non-natural notes. With this style, every note gets an accidental sign, including natural signs.\n\n \n\nteaching\nThis rule is intended for students, and makes it easy to create scale sheets with automatically created cautionary accidentals. Accidentals are printed like with modern, but cautionary accidentals are added for all sharp or flat tones specified by the key signature, except if the note is immediately repeated.\n\n \n\nno-reset\nThis is the same as default but with accidentals lasting ‘forever’ and not only within the same measure:\n\n \n\nforget\nThis is the opposite of no-reset: Accidentals are not remembered at all – and hence all accidentals are typeset relative to the key signature, regardless of what came before in the music.\n\n \n\n",

    documentation:
      "The within-system vertical spacing mechanisms are controlled by two sets of grob properties. The first set is associated with the VerticalAxisGroup grob, which is created by all staves and non-staff lines. The second set is associated with the StaffGrouper grob, which can be created by staff-groups, but only if explicitly called. These properties are described individually at the end of this section.\n\nThe names of these properties (except for staff-affinity) follow the format item1-item2-spacing, where item1 and item2 are the items to be spaced. Note that item2 is not necessarily below item1; for example, nonstaff-relatedstaff-spacing will measure upwards from the non-staff line if staff-affinity is UP.\n\nEach distance is measured between the reference points of the two items. The reference point for a staff is the vertical center of its StaffSymbol (i.e. the middle line if line-count is odd; the middle space if line-count is even). The reference points for individual non-staff lines are given in the following table:\n\nNon-staff line\tReference point\nChordNames\tbaseline\nNoteNames\tbaseline\nLyrics\tbaseline\nDynamics\tmid-height of ‘m’\nFiguredBass\thighest point\nFretBoards\ttop line\n\n\nIn the following image, horizontal lines indicate the positions of these reference points:\n\nEach of the vertical spacing grob properties (except staff-affinity) uses the same alist structure as the \\paper spacing variables discussed in Flexible vertical spacing \\paper variables. Specific methods for modifying alists are discussed in Modifying alists. Grob properties should be adjusted with an \\override inside a \\score or \\layout block, and not inside a \\paper block.\n\nThe following example demonstrates the two ways these alists can be modified. The first declaration updates one key-value individually, and the second completely re-defines the property:\n\n    \\new Staff \\with {\n      \\override VerticalAxisGroup.default-staff-staff-spacing.basic-distance = #10\n    } { … }\n    \\new Staff \\with {\n      \\override VerticalAxisGroup.default-staff-staff-spacing =\n        #'((basic-distance . 10)\n           (minimum-distance . 9)\n           (padding . 1)\n           (stretchability . 10))\n    } { … }\n\nTo change any spacing settings globally, put them in the \\layout block:\n\n    \\layout {\n      \\context {\n        \\Staff\n        \\override VerticalAxisGroup.default-staff-staff-spacing.basic-distance = #10\n      }\n    }\n\nStandard settings for the vertical spacing grob properties are listed in VerticalAxisGroup and StaffGrouper.

      'Specific contexts, like Staff and Voice, are made from simple building blocks. It is possible to create new types of contexts with different combinations of engraver plug-ins.\n\nThe next example shows how to build a different type of Voice context from scratch. It will be similar to Voice, but only prints centered slash note heads. It can be used to indicate improvisation in jazz pieces,\n\nThese settings are defined within a \\context block inside a \\layout block,\n\n    \\layout {\n      \\context {\n        …\n      }\n    }\n\nIn the following discussion, the example input shown should go in place of the … in the previous fragment.\n\nFirst it is necessary to define a name for the new context:\n\n    \\name ImproVoice\n\nSince it is similar to the Voice context, we want commands that work in (existing) Voice contexts to continue working. This is achieved by giving the new context an alias of Voice,\n\n    \\alias Voice\n\nThe context will print notes and instructive texts, so we need to add the engravers which provide this functionality, plus the engraver which groups notes, stems and rests which occur at the same musical moment into columns,\n\n    \\consists "Note_heads_engraver"\n    \\consists "Text_engraver"\n    \\consists "Rhythmic_column_engraver"\n\nThe note heads should all be placed on the center line,\n\n    \\consists "Pitch_squash_engraver"\n    squashedPosition = #0\n\nThe Pitch_squash_engraver modifies note heads (created by the Note_heads_engraver) and sets their vertical position to the value of squashedPosition, in this case 0, the center line.\n\nThe notes look like a slash, and have no stem,\n\n    \\override NoteHead.style = #\'slash\n    \\hide Stem\n\nAll these plug-ins have to communicate under the control of the context. The mechanisms with which contexts communicate are established by declaring the context \\type. Within a \\layout block, most contexts will be of type Engraver_group. Some special contexts and contexts in \\midi blocks use other context types. Copying and modifying an existing context definition will also fill in the type. Since this example creates a definition from scratch, it needs to be specified explicitly.\n\n    \\type "Engraver_group"\n\nPut together, we get\n\n    \\context {\n      \\name ImproVoice\n      \\type "Engraver_group"\n      \\consists "Note_heads_engraver"\n      \\consists "Text_engraver"\n      \\consists "Rhythmic_column_engraver"\n      \\consists "Pitch_squash_engraver"\n      squashedPosition = #0\n      \\override NoteHead.style = #\'slash\n      \\hide Stem\n      \\alias Voice\n    }',

The first set is associated with the VerticalAxisGroup grob, which is created by all staves and non-staff lines. The second set is associated with the StaffGrouper grob, which can be created by staff-groups, but only if explicitly called. These properties are described individually at the end of this section.\n\nThe names of these properties (except for staff-affinity) follow the format item1-item2-spacing, where item1 and item2 are the items to be spaced. Note that item2 is not necessarily below item1; for example, nonstaff-relatedstaff-spacing will measure upwards from the non-staff line if staff-affinity is UP.\n\nEach distance is measured between the reference points of the two items. The reference point for a staff is the vertical center of its StaffSymbol (i.e. the middle line if line-count is odd; the middle space if line-count is even). The reference points for individual non-staff lines are given in the following table:\n\nNon-staff line\tReference point\nChordNames\tbaseline\nNoteNames\tbaseline\nLyrics\tbaseline\nDynamics\tmid-height of ‘m’\nFiguredBass\thighest point\nFretBoards\ttop line\n\n\nIn the following image, horizontal lines indicate the positions of these reference points:\n\nEach of the vertical spacing grob properties (except staff-affinity) uses the same alist structure as the \\paper spacing variables discussed in Flexible vertical spacing \\paper variables. Specific methods for modifying alists are discussed in Modifying alists. Grob properties should be adjusted with an \\override inside a \\score or \\layout block, and not inside a \\paper block.\n\nThe following example demonstrates the two ways these alists can be modified. The first declaration updates one key-value individually, and the second completely re-defines the property:\n\n    \\new Staff \\with {\n      \\override VerticalAxisGroup.default-staff-staff-spacing.basic-distance = #10\n    } { … }\n    \\new Staff \\with {\n      \\override VerticalAxisGroup.default-staff-staff-spacing =\n        #'((basic-distance . 10)\n           (minimum-distance . 9)\n           (padding . 1)\n           (stretchability . 10))\n    } { … }\n\nTo change any spacing settings globally, put them in the \\layout block:\n\n    \\layout {\n      \\context {\n        \\Staff\n        \\override VerticalAxisGroup.default-staff-staff-spacing.basic-distance = #10\n      }\n    }\n\nStandard settings for the vertical spacing grob properties are listed in VerticalAxisGroup and StaffGrouper.

Normally these would delimit the same group of notes, but this is not required: the two commands are independent.\n\nIn the following example the eight 16th notes occupy exactly the same time as a half note, but the first note is one half as long as the last one, with the intermediate notes gradually lengthening.

      "Fonts are handled through several libraries. FontConfig is used to detect available fonts on the system; the selected fonts are rendered using Pango.\n\nMusic notation fonts can be described as a set of specific glyphs, ordered in several families. The following syntax allows various LilyPond feta non-text fonts to be used directly in markup mode:\n\n    a1^\\markup {\n      \\vcenter {\n        \\override #'(font-encoding . fetaBraces)\n        \\lookup #\"brace120\"\n        \\override #'(font-encoding . fetaText)\n        \\column { 1 3 sf }\n        \\override #'(font-encoding . fetaMusic)\n        \\lookup #\"noteheads.s0petrucci\"\n      }\n    }\n\nHowever, all these glyphs except the braces of various sizes contained in fetaBraces are available using the simpler syntax described in Music notation inside markup.\n\nWhen using the glyphs contained in fetaBraces, the size of the brace is specified by the numerical part of the glyph name, in arbitrary units. Any integer from 0 to 575 inclusive may be specified, 0 giving the smallest brace. The optimum value must be determined by trial and error. These glyphs are all left braces; right braces may be obtained by rotation, see Rotating objects.\n\nThree families of text fonts are made available: the roman (serif) font, that defaults to New Century Schoolbook, the sans font and the monospaced typewriter font – these last two families are determined by the Pango installation.\n\nNote: There are no default fonts associated with the sans and typewriter font-families. An input file that specifies either of these can lead to different output on different computers. To ensure consistent output among multiple platforms, fonts must be specified by name, and those fonts must be available on any system that processes the file. See Single entry fonts and Entire document fonts.\n\n\n\nEach family may include different shapes and series. The following example demonstrates the ability to select alternate families, shapes, series and sizes. The value supplied to font-size is the required change from the default size.\n\n    \\override Score.RehearsalMark.font-family = #'typewriter\n    \\mark \\markup \"Ouverture\"\n    \\override Voice.TextScript.font-shape = #'italic\n    \\override Voice.TextScript.font-series = #'bold\n    d2.^\\markup \"Allegro\"\n    \\override Voice.TextScript.font-size = #-3\n    c4^smaller\n\nA similar syntax may be used in markup mode; however in this case it is preferable to use the simpler syntax explained in Selecting font and font size:\n\n    \\markup {\n      \\column {\n        \\line {\n          \\override #'(font-shape . italic)\n          \\override #'(font-size . 4)\n          Idomeneo,\n        }\n        \\line {\n          \\override #'(font-family . typewriter)\n          {\n            \\override #'(font-series . bold)\n            re\n            di\n          }\n          \\override #'(font-family . sans)\n          Creta\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\nAlthough it is easy to switch between preconfigured fonts, it is also possible to use other fonts, as explained in the following sections: Single entry fonts and Entire document fonts.",

Normally these would delimit the same group of notes, but this is not required: the two commands are independent.\n\nIn the following example the eight 16th notes occupy exactly the same time as a half note, but the first note is one half as long as the last one, with the intermediate notes gradually lengthening.

    documentation:
      "The within-system vertical spacing mechanisms are controlled by two sets of grob properties. The first set is associated with the VerticalAxisGroup grob, which is created by all staves and non-staff lines. The second set is associated with the StaffGrouper grob, which can be created by staff-groups, but only if explicitly called. These properties are described individually at the end of this section.\n\nThe names of these properties (except for staff-affinity) follow the format item1-item2-spacing, where item1 and item2 are the items to be spaced. Note that item2 is not necessarily below item1; for example, nonstaff-relatedstaff-spacing will measure upwards from the non-staff line if staff-affinity is UP.\n\nEach distance is measured between the reference points of the two items. The reference point for a staff is the vertical center of its StaffSymbol (i.e. the middle line if line-count is odd; the middle space if line-count is even). The reference points for individual non-staff lines are given in the following table:\n\nNon-staff line\tReference point\nChordNames\tbaseline\nNoteNames\tbaseline\nLyrics\tbaseline\nDynamics\tmid-height of ‘m’\nFiguredBass\thighest point\nFretBoards\ttop line\n\n\nIn the following image, horizontal lines indicate the positions of these reference points:\n\nEach of the vertical spacing grob properties (except staff-affinity) uses the same alist structure as the \\paper spacing variables discussed in Flexible vertical spacing \\paper variables. Specific methods for modifying alists are discussed in Modifying alists. Grob properties should be adjusted with an \\override inside a \\score or \\layout block, and not inside a \\paper block.\n\nThe following example demonstrates the two ways these alists can be modified. The first declaration updates one key-value individually, and the second completely re-defines the property:\n\n    \\new Staff \\with {\n      \\override VerticalAxisGroup.default-staff-staff-spacing.basic-distance = #10\n    } { … }\n    \\new Staff \\with {\n      \\override VerticalAxisGroup.default-staff-staff-spacing =\n        #'((basic-distance . 10)\n           (minimum-distance . 9)\n           (padding . 1)\n           (stretchability . 10))\n    } { … }\n\nTo change any spacing settings globally, put them in the \\layout block:\n\n    \\layout {\n      \\context {\n        \\Staff\n        \\override VerticalAxisGroup.default-staff-staff-spacing.basic-distance = #10\n      }\n    }\n\nStandard settings for the vertical spacing grob properties are listed in VerticalAxisGroup and StaffGrouper.

    documentation:
      'Specific contexts, like Staff and Voice, are made from simple building blocks. It is possible to create new types of contexts with different combinations of engraver plug-ins.\n\nThe next example shows how to build a different type of Voice context from scratch. It will be similar to Voice, but only prints centered slash note heads. It can be used to indicate improvisation in jazz pieces,\n\nThese settings are defined within a \\context block inside a \\layout block,\n\n    \\layout {\n      \\context {\n        …\n      }\n    }\n\nIn the following discussion, the example input shown should go in place of the … in the previous fragment.\n\nFirst it is necessary to define a name for the new context:\n\n    \\name ImproVoice\n\nSince it is similar to the Voice context, we want commands that work in (existing) Voice contexts to continue working. This is achieved by giving the new context an alias of Voice,\n\n    \\alias Voice\n\nThe context will print notes and instructive texts, so we need to add the engravers which provide this functionality, plus the engraver which groups notes, stems and rests which occur at the same musical moment into columns,\n\n    \\consists "Note_heads_engraver"\n    \\consists "Text_engraver"\n    \\consists "Rhythmic_column_engraver"\n\nThe note heads should all be placed on the center line,\n\n    \\consists "Pitch_squash_engraver"\n    squashedPosition = #0\n\nThe Pitch_squash_engraver modifies note heads (created by the Note_heads_engraver) and sets their vertical position to the value of squashedPosition, in this case 0, the center line.\n\nThe notes look like a slash, and have no stem,\n\n    \\override NoteHead.style = #\'slash\n    \\hide Stem\n\nAll these plug-ins have to communicate under the control of the context. The mechanisms with which contexts communicate are established by declaring the context \\type. Within a \\layout block, most contexts will be of type Engraver_group. Some special contexts and contexts in \\midi blocks use other context types. Copying and modifying an existing context definition will also fill in the type. Since this example creates a definition from scratch, it needs to be specified explicitly.\n\n    \\type "Engraver_group"\n\nPut together, we get\n\n    \\context {\n      \\name ImproVoice\n      \\type "Engraver_group"\n      \\consists "Note_heads_engraver"\n      \\consists "Text_engraver"\n      \\consists "Rhythmic_column_engraver"\n      \\consists "Pitch_squash_engraver"\n      squashedPosition = #0\n      \\override NoteHead.style = #\'slash\n      \\hide Stem\n      \\alias Voice\n    }',

LilyPond’s rule for the vertical placement of outside-staff objects is to place them as close to the staff as possible but not so close that they collide with another object.\n\nLilyPond uses the outside-staff-priority property to determine whether a grob is an outside-staff object: if outside-staff-priority is a number, the grob is an outside-staff object.

      "Automatic part combining is used to merge two separate parts of music onto a single staff. This can be especially helpful when typesetting orchestral scores. A single Voice is printed while the two parts of music are the same, but in places where they differ, a second Voice is printed. Stem directions are set up & down accordingly while Solo and a due parts are also identified and marked appropriately.\n\nThe syntax for automatic part combining is:\n\n    \\partcombine musicexpr1 musicexpr2\n\nThe following example demonstrates the basic functionality, putting parts on a single staff as polyphony and setting stem directions accordingly. The same variables are used for the independent parts and the combined staff.\n\n    instrumentOne = \\relative c' {\n      c4 d e f |\n      R1 |\n      d'4 c b a |\n      b4 g2 f4 |\n      e1 |\n    }\n    instrumentTwo = \\relative g' {\n      R1 |\n      g4 a b c |\n      d4 c b a |\n      g4 f( e) d |\n      e1 |\n    }\n    <<\n      \\new Staff \\instrumentOne\n      \\new Staff \\instrumentTwo\n      \\new Staff \\partcombine \\instrumentOne \\instrumentTwo\n    >>\n\nBoth parts have identical notes in the third measure, so only one instance of the notes is printed. Stem, slur, and tie directions are set automatically, depending on whether the parts are playing solo or in unison. When needed in polyphony situations, the first part (with context called one) gets “up” stems, while the second (called two) always gets “down” stems. In solo situations, the first and second parts get marked with “Solo” and “Solo II”, respectively. The unison (a due) parts are marked with the text “a2”.\n\nBoth arguments to \\partcombine will be interpreted as separate Voice contexts, so if the music is being specified in relative mode then both parts must contain a \\relative function, i.e.,\n\n    \\partcombine\n      \\relative … musicexpr1\n      \\relative … musicexpr2\n\nA \\relative section that encloses a \\partcombine has no effect on the pitches of musicexpr1 or musicexpr2.",

The direction takes the argument UP or DOWN, and corresponds to the first and second voices respectively, determining how the cue notes are printed in relation to the other voice.\n\n    fluteNotes = \\relative c\'\' {\n      r2. c4 | d8 c d e fis2 | g2 d |\n    }\n    oboeNotes = \\relative c\'\' {\n      R1\n      \\new CueVoice { \\set instrumentCueName = "flute" }\n      \\cueDuring #"flute" #UP { R1 }\n      g2 c,\n    }\n    \\addQuote "flute" { \\fluteNotes }\n    \\new Staff {\n      \\oboeNotes\n    }\n\nIt is possible to adjust which aspects of the music are quoted with \\cueDuring by setting the quotedCueEventTypes property. Its default value is \'(note-event rest-event tie-event beam-event tuplet-span-event), which means that only notes, rests, ties, beams and tuplets are quoted, but not articulations, dynamic marks, markup etc.\n\nNote: When a Voice starts with cueDuring, as in the following example, the Voice context must be explicitly declared, or else the entire music expression would belong to the CueVoice context.\n\n\n\n    oboeNotes = \\relative c\'\' {\n      r2 r8 d16(\\f f e g f a)\n      g8 g16 g g2.\n    }\n    \\addQuote "oboe" { \\oboeNotes }\n    \\new Voice \\relative c\'\' {\n      \\set Score.quotedCueEventTypes = #\'(note-event rest-event tie-event\n                                          beam-event tuplet-span-event\n                                          dynamic-event slur-event)\n      \\cueDuring #"oboe" #UP { R1 }\n      g2 c,\n    }\n\nThe name of the instrument playing the cue can be printed by setting the instrumentCueName property in a temporary CueVoice context. The placement and style of the instrumentCueName is controlled by the InstrumentSwitch object, see Instrument names. If the cue notes require a change in clef, this can be done manually but the original clef should also be restored manually at the end of the cue notes.\n\n    fluteNotes = \\relative c\'\' {\n      r2. c4 d8 c d e fis2 g2 d2\n    }\n    bassoonNotes = \\relative c {\n      \\clef bass\n      R1\n      \\clef treble\n      \\new CueVoice { \\set instrumentCueName = "flute" }\n      \\cueDuring #"flute" #UP { R1 }\n      \\clef bass\n      g4. b8 d2\n    }\n    \\addQuote "flute" { \\fluteNotes }\n    \\new Staff {\n      \\bassoonNotes\n    }\n\nAlternatively, the \\cueDuringWithClef function can be used instead.

    documentation:
      '\\markup commands in the \\header block are useful for simple text formatting, but they do not allow precise control over the placement of titles. To customize the placement of the text fields, change either or both of the following \\paper variables:\n\n - bookTitleMarkup\n - scoreTitleMarkup\n\nThe placement of titles when using the default values of these \\markup variables is shown in the examples in Default layout of bookpart and score titles.\n\nThe default settings for scoreTitleMarkup as defined in ‘ly/titling-init.ly’ are:\n\n    scoreTitleMarkup = \\markup { \\column {\n      \\on-the-fly \\print-all-headers { \\bookTitleMarkup \\hspace #1 }\n      \\fill-line {\n        \\fromproperty #\'header:piece\n        \\fromproperty #\'header:opus\n      }\n    }\n    }\n\nThis places the piece and opus text fields at opposite ends of the same line:\n\n    \\score {\n      { s1 }\n      \\header {\n        piece = "PRAELUDIUM I"\n        opus = "BWV 846"\n      }\n    }\n\nThis example redefines scoreTitleMarkup so that the piece text field is centered and in a large, bold font.\n\n    \\book {\n      \\paper {\n        indent = 0\\mm\n        scoreTitleMarkup = \\markup {\n          \\fill-line {\n            \\null\n            \\fontsize #4 \\bold \\fromproperty #\'header:piece\n            \\fromproperty #\'header:opus\n          }\n        }\n      }\n      \\header { tagline = ##f }\n      \\score {\n        { s1 }\n        \\header {\n          piece = "PRAELUDIUM I"\n          opus = "BWV 846"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\nText fields not normally effective in score \\header blocks can be printed in the Score Title area if print-all-headers is placed inside the \\paper block. A disadvantage of using this method is that text fields that are intended specifically for the Bookpart Title area need to be manually suppressed in every \\score block. See Titles explained.\n\nTo avoid this, add the desired text field to the scoreTitleMarkup definition. In the following example, the composer text field (normally associated with bookTitleMarkup) is added to scoreTitleMarkup, allowing each score to list a different composer:\n\n    \\book {\n      \\paper {\n        indent = 0\\mm\n        scoreTitleMarkup = \\markup {\n          \\fill-line {\n            \\null\n            \\fontsize #4 \\bold \\fromproperty #\'header:piece\n            \\fromproperty #\'header:composer\n          }\n        }\n      }\n      \\header { tagline = ##f }\n      \\score {\n        { s1 }\n        \\header {\n          piece = "MENUET"\n          composer = "Christian Petzold"\n        }\n      }\n      \\score {\n        { s1 }\n        \\header {\n          piece = "RONDEAU"\n          composer = "François Couperin"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n\nIt is also possible to create your own custom text fields, and refer to them in the markup definition.\n\n    \\book {\n      \\paper {\n        indent = 0\\mm\n        scoreTitleMarkup = \\markup {\n          \\fill-line {\n            \\null\n            \\override #`(direction . ,UP) {\n              \\dir-column {\n                \\center-align \\fontsize #-1 \\bold\n                  \\fromproperty #\'header:mycustomtext %% User-defined field\n                \\center-align \\fontsize #4 \\bold\n                  \\fromproperty #\'header:piece\n              }\n            }\n            \\fromproperty #\'header:opus\n          }\n        }\n      }\n      \\header { tagline = ##f }\n      \\score {\n        { s1 }\n        \\header {\n          piece = "FUGA I"\n          mycustomtext = "A 4 VOCI" %% User-defined field\n          opus = "BWV 846"\n        }\n      }\n    }',

    documentation:
      "The within-system vertical spacing mechanisms are controlled by two sets of grob properties. The first set is associated with the VerticalAxisGroup grob, which is created by all staves and non-staff lines. The second set is associated with the StaffGrouper grob, which can be created by staff-groups, but only if explicitly called. These properties are described individually at the end of this section.\n\nThe names of these properties (except for staff-affinity) follow the format item1-item2-spacing, where item1 and item2 are the items to be spaced. Note that item2 is not necessarily below item1; for example, nonstaff-relatedstaff-spacing will measure upwards from the non-staff line if staff-affinity is UP.\n\nEach distance is measured between the reference points of the two items. The reference point for a staff is the vertical center of its StaffSymbol (i.e. the middle line if line-count is odd; the middle space if line-count is even). The reference points for individual non-staff lines are given in the following table:\n\nNon-staff line\tReference point\nChordNames\tbaseline\nNoteNames\tbaseline\nLyrics\tbaseline\nDynamics\tmid-height of ‘m’\nFiguredBass\thighest point\nFretBoards\ttop line\n\n\nIn the following image, horizontal lines indicate the positions of these reference points:\n\nEach of the vertical spacing grob properties (except staff-affinity) uses the same alist structure as the \\paper spacing variables discussed in Flexible vertical spacing \\paper variables. Specific methods for modifying alists are discussed in Modifying alists. Grob properties should be adjusted with an \\override inside a \\score or \\layout block, and not inside a \\paper block.\n\nThe following example demonstrates the two ways these alists can be modified. The first declaration updates one key-value individually, and the second completely re-defines the property:\n\n    \\new Staff \\with {\n      \\override VerticalAxisGroup.default-staff-staff-spacing.basic-distance = #10\n    } { … }\n    \\new Staff \\with {\n      \\override VerticalAxisGroup.default-staff-staff-spacing =\n        #'((basic-distance . 10)\n           (minimum-distance . 9)\n           (padding . 1)\n           (stretchability . 10))\n    } { … }\n\nTo change any spacing settings globally, put them in the \\layout block:\n\n    \\layout {\n      \\context {\n        \\Staff\n        \\override VerticalAxisGroup.default-staff-staff-spacing.basic-distance = #10\n      }\n    }\n\nStandard settings for the vertical spacing grob properties are listed in VerticalAxisGroup and StaffGrouper.

If you for some reason want to show the key signature, you can use \\showKeySignature instead.\n\nSome modern music use cross fingering on c and f to flatten those notes. This can be indicated by cflat or fflat. Similarly, the piobaireachd high g can be written gflat when it occurs in light music.',

The first declaration updates one key-value individually, and the second completely re-defines the property:\n\n    \\new Staff \\with {\n      \\override VerticalAxisGroup.default-staff-staff-spacing.basic-distance = #10\n    } { … }\n    \\new Staff \\with {\n      \\override VerticalAxisGroup.default-staff-staff-spacing =\n        #'((basic-distance . 10)\n           (minimum-distance . 9)\n           (padding . 1)\n           (stretchability . 10))\n    } { … }\n\nTo change any spacing settings globally, put them in the \\layout block:\n\n    \\layout {\n      \\context {\n        \\Staff\n        \\override VerticalAxisGroup.default-staff-staff-spacing.basic-distance = #10\n      }\n    }\n\nStandard settings for the vertical spacing grob properties are listed in VerticalAxisGroup and StaffGrouper. Default overrides for specific types of non-staff lines are listed in the relevant context descriptions in Contexts.",

      "Any desired string tuning can be created. The \\stringTuning function can be used to define a string tuning which can be used to set stringTunings for the current context.\n\nIts argument is a chord construct defining the pitches of each string in the tuning. The chord construct must be in absolute octave mode, see Absolute octave entry. The string with the highest number (generally the lowest string) must come first in the chord. For example, we can define a string tuning for a four-string instrument with pitches of a'', d'', g', and c':\n\n    mynotes = {\n      c'4 e' g' c'' |\n      e''4 g'' b'' c'''\n    }\n    <<\n      \\new Staff {\n        \\clef treble\n        \\mynotes\n      }\n      \\new TabStaff {\n        \\set Staff.stringTunings = \\stringTuning <c' g' d'' a''>\n        \\mynotes\n      }\n    >>\n\nThe stringTunings property is also used by FretBoards to calculate automatic fret diagrams.\n\nString tunings are used as part of the hash key for predefined fret diagrams (see Predefined fret diagrams).\n\nThe previous example could also be written as follows:\n\n    custom-tuning = \\stringTuning <c' g' d'' a''>\n    mynotes = {\n      c'4 e' g' c'' |\n      e''4 g'' b'' c'''\n    }\n    <<\n      \\new Staff {\n        \\clef treble\n        \\mynotes\n      }\n      \\new TabStaff {\n        \\set TabStaff.stringTunings = #custom-tuning\n        \\mynotes\n      }\n    >>\n\nInternally, a string tuning is a Scheme list of string pitches, one for each string, ordered by string number from 1 to N, where string 1 is at the top of the tablature staff and string N is at the bottom. This ordinarily results in ordering from highest pitch to lowest pitch, but some instruments (e.g. ukulele) do not have strings ordered by pitch.\n\nA string pitch in a string tuning list is a LilyPond pitch object. Pitch objects are created with the Scheme function ly:make-pitch (see Scheme functions).\n\n\\stringTuning creates such an object from chord input.\n\nLilyPond automatically calculates the number of lines in the TabStaff and the number of strings in an automatically calculated FretBoard as the number of elements in stringTunings.\n\nTo let all TabStaff contexts use the same custom tuning by default, you can use\n\n    \\layout {\n      \\context {\n        \\TabStaff\n        stringTunings = \\stringTuning <c' g' d'' a''>\n      }\n    }",

LilyPond automatically sets the correct transposition for predefined tunings. The following example is for bass guitar, which sounds an octave lower than written.\n\n    <<\n      \\new Voice \\with {\n        \\omit StringNumber\n      } {\n        \\clef "bass_8"\n        \\relative c, {\n          c4 d e f\n        }\n      }\n      \\new TabStaff \\with {\n        stringTunings = #bass-tuning\n      } {\n        \\relative c, {\n          c4 d e f\n        }\n      }\n    >>\n\nThe default string tuning is guitar-tuning, which is the standard EADGBE tuning.

      "The within-system vertical spacing mechanisms are controlled by two sets of grob properties. The first set is associated with the VerticalAxisGroup grob, which is created by all staves and non-staff lines. The second set is associated with the StaffGrouper grob, which can be created by staff-groups, but only if explicitly called. These properties are described individually at the end of this section.\n\nThe names of these properties (except for staff-affinity) follow the format item1-item2-spacing, where item1 and item2 are the items to be spaced. Note that item2 is not necessarily below item1; for example, nonstaff-relatedstaff-spacing will measure upwards from the non-staff line if staff-affinity is UP.\n\nEach distance is measured between the reference points of the two items. The reference point for a staff is the vertical center of its StaffSymbol (i.e. the middle line if line-count is odd; the middle space if line-count is even). The reference points for individual non-staff lines are given in the following table:\n\nNon-staff line\tReference point\nChordNames\tbaseline\nNoteNames\tbaseline\nLyrics\tbaseline\nDynamics\tmid-height of ‘m’\nFiguredBass\thighest point\nFretBoards\ttop line\n\n\nIn the following image, horizontal lines indicate the positions of these reference points:\n\nEach of the vertical spacing grob properties (except staff-affinity) uses the same alist structure as the \\paper spacing variables discussed in Flexible vertical spacing \\paper variables. Specific methods for modifying alists are discussed in Modifying alists. Grob properties should be adjusted with an \\override inside a \\score or \\layout block, and not inside a \\paper block.\n\nThe following example demonstrates the two ways these alists can be modified. The first declaration updates one key-value individually, and the second completely re-defines the property:\n\n    \\new Staff \\with {\n      \\override VerticalAxisGroup.default-staff-staff-spacing.basic-distance = #10\n    } { … }\n    \\new Staff \\with {\n      \\override VerticalAxisGroup.default-staff-staff-spacing =\n        #'((basic-distance . 10)\n           (minimum-distance . 9)\n           (padding . 1)\n           (stretchability . 10))\n    } { … }\n\nTo change any spacing settings globally, put them in the \\layout block:\n\n    \\layout {\n      \\context {\n        \\Staff\n        \\override VerticalAxisGroup.default-staff-staff-spacing.basic-distance = #10\n      }\n    }\n\nStandard settings for the vertical spacing grob properties are listed in VerticalAxisGroup and StaffGrouper.

    detail: "Automatic accidentals",
    documentation:
      "There are many different conventions on how to typeset accidentals. LilyPond provides a function to specify which accidental style to use. This function is called as follows:\n\n    \\new Staff <<\n      \\accidentalStyle voice\n      { … }\n    >>\n\nThe accidental style applies to the current Staff by default (with the exception of the styles piano and piano-cautionary, which are explained below). Optionally, the function can take a second argument that determines in which scope the style should be changed. For example, to use the same style in all staves of the current StaffGroup, use:\n\n    \\accidentalStyle StaffGroup.voice\n\nThe following accidental styles are supported. To demonstrate each style, we use the following example:\n\n    musicA = {\n      <<\n        \\relative c' {\n          cis'8 fis, bes4 <a cis>8 f bis4 |\n          cis2. <c, g'>4 |\n        }\n        \\\\\n        \\relative c' {\n          ais'2 cis, |\n          fis8 b a4 cis2 |\n        }\n      >>\n    }\n    musicB = {\n      \\clef bass\n      \\new Voice {\n        \\voiceTwo \\relative c' {\n          <fis, a cis>8[ <fis a cis>\n          \\change Staff = up\n          cis' cis\n          \\change Staff = down\n          <fis, a> <fis a>]\n          \\showStaffSwitch\n          \\change Staff = up\n          dis'4 |\n          \\change Staff = down\n          <fis, a cis>4 gis <f a d>2 |\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    \\new PianoStaff {\n      <<\n        \\context Staff = \"up\" {\n          \\accidentalStyle default\n          \\musicA\n        }\n        \\context Staff = \"down\" {\n          \\accidentalStyle default\n          \\musicB\n        }\n      >>\n    }\n\nNote that the last lines of this example can be replaced by the following, as long as the same accidental style should be used in both staves.\n\n    \\new PianoStaff {\n      <<\n        \\context Staff = \"up\" {\n          %%% change the next line as desired:\n          \\accidentalStyle Score.default\n          \\musicA\n        }\n        \\context Staff = \"down\" {\n          \\musicB\n        }\n      >>\n    }\n\ndefault\nThis is the default typesetting behavior. It corresponds to eighteenth-century common practice: accidentals are remembered to the end of the measure in which they occur and only in their own octave. Thus, in the example below, no natural signs are printed before the b in the second measure or the last c:\n\n \n\nvoice\nThe normal behavior is to remember the accidentals at Staff-level. In this style, however, accidentals are typeset individually for each voice. Apart from that, the rule is similar to default.\n\nAs a result, accidentals from one voice do not get canceled in other voices, which is often an unwanted result: in the following example, it is hard to determine whether the second a should be played natural or sharp. The voice option should therefore be used only if the voices are to be read solely by individual musicians. If the staff is to be used by one musician (e.g., a conductor or in a piano score) then modern or modern-cautionary should be used instead.\n\n \n\nmodern\nThis rule corresponds to the common practice in the twentieth century. It omits some extra natural signs, which were traditionally prefixed to a sharp following a double sharp, or a flat following a double flat. The modern rule prints the same accidentals as default, with two additions that serve to avoid ambiguity: after temporary accidentals, cancellation marks are printed also in the following measure (for notes in the same octave) and, in the same measure, for notes in other octaves. Hence the naturals before the b and the c in the second measure of the upper staff:\n\n \n\nmodern-cautionary\nThis rule is similar to modern, but the ‘extra’ accidentals (the ones not typeset by default) are typeset as cautionary accidentals. They are by default printed with parentheses, but they can also be printed in reduced size by defining the cautionary-style property of AccidentalSuggestion.\n\n \n\nmodern-voice\nThis rule is used for multivoice accidentals to be read both by musicians playing one voice and musicians playing all voices. Accidentals are typeset for each voice, but they are canceled across voices in the same Staff. Hence, the a in the last measure is canceled because the previous cancellation was in a different voice, and the d in the lower staff is canceled because of the accidental in a different voice in the previous measure:\n\n \n\nmodern-voice-cautionary\nThis rule is the same as modern-voice, but with the extra accidentals (the ones not typeset by voice) typeset as cautionaries. Even though all accidentals typeset by default are typeset with this rule, some of them are typeset as cautionaries.\n\n \n\npiano\nThis rule reflects twentieth-century practice for piano notation. Its behavior is very similar to modern style, but here accidentals also get canceled across the staves in the same GrandStaff or PianoStaff, hence all the cancellations of the final notes.\n\nThis accidental style applies to the current GrandStaff or PianoStaff by default.\n\n \n\npiano-cautionary\nThis is the same as piano but with the extra accidentals typeset as cautionaries.\n\n \n\nneo-modern\nThis rule reproduces a common practice in contemporary music: accidentals are printed like with modern, but they are printed again if the same note appears later in the same measure – except if the note is immediately repeated.\n\n \n\nneo-modern-cautionary\nThis rule is similar to neo-modern, but the extra accidentals are printed as cautionary accidentals.\n\n \n\nneo-modern-voice\nThis rule is used for multivoice accidentals to be read both by musicians playing one voice and musicians playing all voices. Accidentals are typeset for each voice as with neo-modern, but they are canceled across voices in the same Staff.\n\n \n\nneo-modern-voice-cautionary\nThis rule is similar to neo-modern-voice, but the extra accidentals are printed as cautionary accidentals.\n\n \n\ndodecaphonic\nThis rule reflects a practice introduced by composers at the beginning of the 20th century, in an attempt to abolish the hierarchy between natural and non-natural notes. With this style, every note gets an accidental sign, including natural signs.\n\n \n\nteaching\nThis rule is intended for students, and makes it easy to create scale sheets with automatically created cautionary accidentals. Accidentals are printed like with modern, but cautionary accidentals are added for all sharp or flat tones specified by the key signature, except if the note is immediately repeated.\n\n \n\nno-reset\nThis is the same as default but with accidentals lasting ‘forever’ and not only within the same measure:\n\n \n\nforget\nThis is the opposite of no-reset: Accidentals are not remembered at all – and hence all accidentals are typeset relative to the key signature, regardless of what came before in the music.\n\n \n\n",

    documentation:
      "The within-system vertical spacing mechanisms are controlled by two sets of grob properties. The first set is associated with the VerticalAxisGroup grob, which is created by all staves and non-staff lines. The second set is associated with the StaffGrouper grob, which can be created by staff-groups, but only if explicitly called. These properties are described individually at the end of this section.\n\nThe names of these properties (except for staff-affinity) follow the format item1-item2-spacing, where item1 and item2 are the items to be spaced. Note that item2 is not necessarily below item1; for example, nonstaff-relatedstaff-spacing will measure upwards from the non-staff line if staff-affinity is UP.\n\nEach distance is measured between the reference points of the two items. The reference point for a staff is the vertical center of its StaffSymbol (i.e. the middle line if line-count is odd; the middle space if line-count is even). The reference points for individual non-staff lines are given in the following table:\n\nNon-staff line\tReference point\nChordNames\tbaseline\nNoteNames\tbaseline\nLyrics\tbaseline\nDynamics\tmid-height of ‘m’\nFiguredBass\thighest point\nFretBoards\ttop line\n\n\nIn the following image, horizontal lines indicate the positions of these reference points:\n\nEach of the vertical spacing grob properties (except staff-affinity) uses the same alist structure as the \\paper spacing variables discussed in Flexible vertical spacing \\paper variables. Specific methods for modifying alists are discussed in Modifying alists. Grob properties should be adjusted with an \\override inside a \\score or \\layout block, and not inside a \\paper block.\n\nThe following example demonstrates the two ways these alists can be modified. The first declaration updates one key-value individually, and the second completely re-defines the property:\n\n    \\new Staff \\with {\n      \\override VerticalAxisGroup.default-staff-staff-spacing.basic-distance = #10\n    } { … }\n    \\new Staff \\with {\n      \\override VerticalAxisGroup.default-staff-staff-spacing =\n        #'((basic-distance . 10)\n           (minimum-distance . 9)\n           (padding . 1)\n           (stretchability . 10))\n    } { … }\n\nTo change any spacing settings globally, put them in the \\layout block:\n\n    \\layout {\n      \\context {\n        \\Staff\n        \\override VerticalAxisGroup.default-staff-staff-spacing.basic-distance = #10\n      }\n    }\n\nStandard settings for the vertical spacing grob properties are listed in VerticalAxisGroup and StaffGrouper.
